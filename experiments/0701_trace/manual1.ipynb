      "To find the marginal distribution of \\( v5 \\) given an intervention to set \\( v4 \\) to 0, we need to consider the structural causal model and the intervention. An intervention to set \\( v4 \\) to 0 means that the causal effect of its parents (in this case, \\( v13 \\) and \\( v11 \\)) on \\( v4 \\) is removed. This intervention does not directly affect \\( v5 \\), but it can indirectly affect \\( v5 \\) through its parents \\( v14 \\) and \\( v0 \\).\n",

      "* This category of errors focuses on mistakes that happened during the derivation of NEW probability distributions in SOLUTION. NEW distributions includes any distribution that is computed in SOLUTIOn but not PROVIDED by QUESTION. For example, the target distribution p($v_i$), is often a NEW probability distribution (which is rarely provided in QUESTION). The SOLUTION will often also contain NEW joint and conditional distributions not directly provided by QUESTION.\n",

      "* A SOLUTION contains a Modeling Error if any the definition or derivation of a NEW probability distribution contains erroneous probability formulas, indicating a potential error in student's knowledge.\n",
      "\n",
      "* In NEW full joint distributions, which often result from multiplying several conditional distributions, erroneous formulas often has incorrect terms, or are missing or have extra terms. This can be a result of making incorrect independence assumptions are made that's not warranted by the graph in QUESTION (e.g substituting  $p(x) \\cdot p(y)$ for $p(x, y)$ or $p(x)$ for $p(x | y)$, when the graph does not suggest independence between x and y). Sometimes the dependence between two variables $v_i$ and $v_j$ is evident only if you look at the full graph or a large enough subgraph (e.g. $v_i$ and $v_j$ are long descendents off of two separate branches off of a common ancestor $v_k$). Sometimes indepedence assumptions are warranted not by the graph structure, but by the numerical value of the distribution (e.g. when $p(V_i=v_i) = 1$ for some $v_i$).\n",
      "\n",
      "* In NEW marginal joint distributions, which involves summing some full joint over values assignments, erroneous formulas often misses summing over some variables (e.g. incorrectly using $p(x) = \\sum_y p(x,y,z)$ when it should have also summed over $z$), or did not sum over all values exhaustively (e.g. incorrectly using $p(x) = p(x,y=0,z=0) + p(x,y=0,z=1)$ which forgets to sum over other values of $y$).\n",
      "\n",
      "* A SOLUTION can also contain a Modeling Error if they did not consider the intervention on $v_i$ properly. This can happen in ONLY two ways, 1) if the SOLUTION attempted to compute the distribution of $v_i$ from its parents, or 2) if the SOLUTION attempted to marginalize over $v_i$ (incorrect since $v_i$ is intervened on and set to a fixed value). \n",

      "What's NOT a Modeling Error? \n",
      "* It is NOT a Modeling Error when the student copied CPTs numerically incorrectly from the QUESTION, or when they multiply or add numbers to incorrect results. This includes misreading the CPTs. These are low-level copy and calculation errors, not Modeling Error.\n",

      "* It is NOT a Modeling Error to ignore the intervention when the intervened on variable $v_i$ is NOT an ancestor of any of the question variable $v_j$. In that case, the intervention has no effect on $v_j$ and one should just compute $v_j$ in the original graph.\n",

The SOLUTION will often also contain NEW joint and conditional distributions not directly provided by QUESTION.\n",

This can be a result of making incorrect independence assumptions are made that's not warranted by the graph in QUESTION (e.g substituting  $p(x) \\cdot p(y)$ for $p(x, y)$ or $p(x)$ for $p(x | y)$, when the graph does not suggest independence between x and y). Sometimes the dependence between two variables $v_i$ and $v_j$ is evident only if you look at the full graph or a large enough subgraph (e.g. $v_i$ and $v_j$ are long descendents off of two separate branches off of a common ancestor $v_k$). Sometimes indepedence assumptions are warranted not by the graph structure, but by the numerical value of the distribution (e.g. when $p(V_i=v_i) = 1$ for some $v_i$).\n",

      "* In NEW marginal joint distributions, which involves summing some full joint over values assignments, erroneous formulas often misses summing over some variables (e.g. incorrectly using $p(x) = \\sum_y p(x,y,z)$ when it should have also summed over $z$), or did not sum over all values exhaustively (e.g. incorrectly using $p(x) = p(x,y=0,z=0) + p(x,y=0,z=1)$ which forgets to sum over other values of $y$).\n",

This can be a result of making incorrect independence assumptions are made that's not warranted by the graph in QUESTION (e.g substituting  $p(x) \\cdot p(y)$ for $p(x, y)$ or $p(x)$ for $p(x | y)$, when the graph does not suggest independence between x and y). Sometimes the dependence between two variables $v_i$ and $v_j$ is evident only if you look at the full graph or a large enough subgraph (e.g. $v_i$ and $v_j$ are long descendents off of two separate branches off of a common ancestor $v_k$). Sometimes indepedence assumptions are warranted not by the graph structure, but by the numerical value of the distribution (e.g. when $p(V_i=v_i) = 1$ for some $v_i$).\n",

Sometimes the dependence between two variables $v_i$ and $v_j$ is evident only if you look at the full graph or a large enough subgraph (e.g. $v_i$ and $v_j$ are long descendents off of two separate branches off of a common ancestor $v_k$). Sometimes indepedence assumptions are warranted not by the graph structure, but by the numerical value of the distribution (e.g. when $p(V_i=v_i) = 1$ for some $v_i$).\n",

      "Modeling Error\n",
      "* This category of errors focuses on mistakes that happened during the derivation of NEW probability distributions in SOLUTION. NEW distributions includes any distribution that is computed in SOLUTIOn but not PROVIDED by QUESTION. For example, the target distribution p($v_i$), is often a NEW probability distribution (which is rarely provided in QUESTION). The SOLUTION will often also contain NEW joint and conditional distributions not directly provided by QUESTION.\n",

      "* A SOLUTION contains a Modeling Error if any the definition or derivation of a NEW probability distribution contains erroneous probability formulas, indicating a potential error in student's knowledge.\n",
      "\n",
      "* In NEW full joint distributions, which often result from multiplying several conditional distributions, erroneous formulas often has incorrect terms, or are missing or have extra terms. This can be a result of making incorrect independence assumptions are made that's not warranted by the graph in QUESTION (e.g substituting  $p(x) \\cdot p(y)$ for $p(x, y)$ or $p(x)$ for $p(x | y)$, when the graph does not suggest independence between x and y). Sometimes the dependence between two variables $v_i$ and $v_j$ is evident only if you look at the full graph or a large enough subgraph (e.g. $v_i$ and $v_j$ are long descendents off of two separate branches off of a common ancestor $v_k$). Sometimes indepedence assumptions are warranted not by the graph structure, but by the numerical value of the distribution (e.g. when $p(V_i=v_i) = 1$ for some $v_i$).\n",
      "\n",
      "* In NEW marginal joint distributions, which involves summing some full joint over values assignments, erroneous formulas often misses summing over some variables (e.g. incorrectly using $p(x) = \\sum_y p(x,y,z)$ when it should have also summed over $z$), or did not sum over all values exhaustively (e.g. incorrectly using $p(x) = p(x,y=0,z=0) + p(x,y=0,z=1)$ which forgets to sum over other values of $y$).\n",
      "\n",
      "* A SOLUTION can also contain a Modeling Error if they did not consider the intervention on $v_i$ properly. This can happen in ONLY two ways, 1) if the SOLUTION attempted to compute the distribution of $v_i$ from its parents, or 2) if the SOLUTION attempted to marginalize over $v_i$ (incorrect since $v_i$ is intervened on and set to a fixed value). \n",
      "\n",
      "What's NOT a Modeling Error? \n",
      "* It is NOT a Modeling Error when the student copied CPTs numerically incorrectly from the QUESTION, or when they multiply or add numbers to incorrect results. This includes misreading the CPTs. These are low-level copy and calculation errors, not Modeling Error.\n",
      "\n",
      "* It is NOT a Modeling Error to ignore the intervention when the intervened on variable $v_i$ is NOT an ancestor of any of the question variable $v_j$. In that case, the intervention has no effect on $v_j$ and one should just compute $v_j$ in the original graph.\n",

Sometimes the dependence between two variables $v_i$ and $v_j$ is evident only if you look at the full graph or a large enough subgraph (e.g. $v_i$ and $v_j$ are long descendents off of two separate branches off of a common ancestor $v_k$). Sometimes indepedence assumptions are warranted not by the graph structure, but by the numerical value of the distribution (e.g. when $p(V_i=v_i) = 1$ for some $v_i$).\n",

For example, the target distribution p($v_i$), is often a NEW probability distribution (which is rarely provided in QUESTION). The SOLUTION will often also contain NEW joint and conditional distributions not directly provided by QUESTION.\n",

This can be a result of making incorrect independence assumptions are made that's not warranted by the graph in QUESTION (e.g substituting  $p(x) \\cdot p(y)$ for $p(x, y)$ or $p(x)$ for $p(x | y)$, when the graph does not suggest independence between x and y). Sometimes the dependence between two variables $v_i$ and $v_j$ is evident only if you look at the full graph or a large enough subgraph (e.g. $v_i$ and $v_j$ are long descendents off of two separate branches off of a common ancestor $v_k$). Sometimes indepedence assumptions are warranted not by the graph structure, but by the numerical value of the distribution (e.g. when $p(V_i=v_i) = 1$ for some $v_i$).\n",
      "\n",
      "* In NEW marginal joint distributions, which involves summing some full joint over values assignments, erroneous formulas often misses summing over some variables (e.g. incorrectly using $p(x) = \\sum_y p(x,y,z)$ when it should have also summed over $z$), or did not sum over all values exhaustively (e.g. incorrectly using $p(x) = p(x,y=0,z=0) + p(x,y=0,z=1)$ which forgets to sum over other values of $y$).\n",

Sometimes the dependence between two variables $v_i$ and $v_j$ is evident only if you look at the full graph or a large enough subgraph (e.g. $v_i$ and $v_j$ are long descendents off of two separate branches off of a common ancestor $v_k$).

      "* This category of errors focuses on mistakes that happened during the derivation of NEW probability distributions in SOLUTION. NEW distributions includes any distribution that is computed in SOLUTIOn but not PROVIDED by QUESTION. For example, the target distribution p($v_i$), is often a NEW probability distribution (which is rarely provided in QUESTION). The SOLUTION will often also contain NEW joint and conditional distributions not directly provided by QUESTION.\n",

      "* In NEW full joint distributions, which often result from multiplying several conditional distributions, erroneous formulas often has incorrect terms, or are missing or have extra terms. This can be a result of making incorrect independence assumptions are made that's not warranted by the graph in QUESTION (e.g substituting  $p(x) \\cdot p(y)$ for $p(x, y)$ or $p(x)$ for $p(x | y)$, when the graph does not suggest independence between x and y). Sometimes the dependence between two variables $v_i$ and $v_j$ is evident only if you look at the full graph or a large enough subgraph (e.g. $v_i$ and $v_j$ are long descendents off of two separate branches off of a common ancestor $v_k$). Sometimes indepedence assumptions are warranted not by the graph structure, but by the numerical value of the distribution (e.g. when $p(V_i=v_i) = 1$ for some $v_i$).\n",
      "\n",
      "* In NEW marginal joint distributions, which involves summing some full joint over values assignments, erroneous formulas often misses summing over some variables (e.g. incorrectly using $p(x) = \\sum_y p(x,y,z)$ when it should have also summed over $z$), or did not sum over all values exhaustively (e.g. incorrectly using $p(x) = p(x,y=0,z=0) + p(x,y=0,z=1)$ which forgets to sum over other values of $y$).\n",
      "\n",
      "* A SOLUTION can also contain a Modeling Error if they did not consider the intervention on $v_i$ properly. This can happen in ONLY two ways, 1) if the SOLUTION attempted to compute the distribution of $v_i$ from its parents, or 2) if the SOLUTION attempted to marginalize over $v_i$ (incorrect since $v_i$ is intervened on and set to a fixed value). \n",
      "\n",
      "What's NOT a Modeling Error? \n",
      "* It is NOT a Modeling Error when the student copied CPTs numerically incorrectly from the QUESTION, or when they multiply or add numbers to incorrect results. This includes misreading the CPTs. These are low-level copy and calculation errors, not Modeling Error.\n",
      "\n",
      "* It is NOT a Modeling Error to ignore the intervention when the intervened on variable $v_i$ is NOT an ancestor of any of the question variable $v_j$. In that case, the intervention has no effect on $v_j$ and one should just compute $v_j$ in the original graph.\n",

NEW distributions includes any distribution that is computed in SOLUTIOn but not PROVIDED by QUESTION. For example, the target distribution p($v_i$), is often a NEW probability distribution (which is rarely provided in QUESTION). The SOLUTION will often also contain NEW joint and conditional distributions not directly provided by QUESTION.\n",

      "* In NEW full joint distributions, which often result from multiplying several conditional distributions, erroneous formulas often has incorrect terms, or are missing or have extra terms. This can be a result of making incorrect independence assumptions are made that's not warranted by the graph in QUESTION (e.g substituting  $p(x) \\cdot p(y)$ for $p(x, y)$ or $p(x)$ for $p(x | y)$, when the graph does not suggest independence between x and y). Sometimes the dependence between two variables $v_i$ and $v_j$ is evident only if you look at the full graph or a large enough subgraph (e.g. $v_i$ and $v_j$ are long descendents off of two separate branches off of a common ancestor $v_k$). Sometimes indepedence assumptions are warranted not by the graph structure, but by the numerical value of the distribution (e.g. when $p(V_i=v_i) = 1$ for some $v_i$).\n",
      "\n",
      "* In NEW marginal joint distributions, which involves summing some full joint over values assignments, erroneous formulas often misses summing over some variables (e.g. incorrectly using $p(x) = \\sum_y p(x,y,z)$ when it should have also summed over $z$), or did not sum over all values exhaustively (e.g. incorrectly using $p(x) = p(x,y=0,z=0) + p(x,y=0,z=1)$ which forgets to sum over other values of $y$).\n",

      "* A SOLUTION can also contain a Modeling Error if they did not consider the intervention on $v_i$ properly. This can happen in ONLY two ways, 1) if the SOLUTION attempted to compute the distribution of $v_i$ from its parents, or 2) if the SOLUTION attempted to marginalize over $v_i$ (incorrect since $v_i$ is intervened on and set to a fixed value). \n",

      "What's NOT a Modeling Error? \n",

      "* It is NOT a Modeling Error to ignore the intervention when the intervened on variable $v_i$ is NOT an ancestor of any of the question variable $v_j$. In that case, the intervention has no effect on $v_j$ and one should just compute $v_j$ in the original graph.\n",

NEW distributions includes any distribution that is computed in SOLUTIOn but not PROVIDED by QUESTION. For example, the target distribution p($v_i$), is often a NEW probability distribution (which is rarely provided in QUESTION). The SOLUTION will often also contain NEW joint and conditional distributions not directly provided by QUESTION.\n",

      "* In NEW full joint distributions, which often result from multiplying several conditional distributions, erroneous formulas often has incorrect terms, or are missing or have extra terms. This can be a result of making incorrect independence assumptions are made that's not warranted by the graph in QUESTION (e.g substituting  $p(x) \\cdot p(y)$ for $p(x, y)$ or $p(x)$ for $p(x | y)$, when the graph does not suggest independence between x and y). Sometimes the dependence between two variables $v_i$ and $v_j$ is evident only if you look at the full graph or a large enough subgraph (e.g. $v_i$ and $v_j$ are long descendents off of two separate branches off of a common ancestor $v_k$). Sometimes indepedence assumptions are warranted not by the graph structure, but by the numerical value of the distribution (e.g. when $p(V_i=v_i) = 1$ for some $v_i$).\n",
      "\n",
      "* In NEW marginal joint distributions, which involves summing some full joint over values assignments, erroneous formulas often misses summing over some variables (e.g. incorrectly using $p(x) = \\sum_y p(x,y,z)$ when it should have also summed over $z$), or did not sum over all values exhaustively (e.g. incorrectly using $p(x) = p(x,y=0,z=0) + p(x,y=0,z=1)$ which forgets to sum over other values of $y$).\n",
      "\n",
      "* A SOLUTION can also contain a Modeling Error if they did not consider the intervention on $v_i$ properly. This can happen in ONLY two ways, 1) if the SOLUTION attempted to compute the distribution of $v_i$ from its parents, or 2) if the SOLUTION attempted to marginalize over $v_i$ (incorrect since $v_i$ is intervened on and set to a fixed value). \n",

      "What's NOT a Modeling Error? \n",
      "* It is NOT a Modeling Error when the student copied CPTs numerically incorrectly from the QUESTION, or when they multiply or add numbers to incorrect results. This includes misreading the CPTs. These are low-level copy and calculation errors, not Modeling Error.\n",

      "* It is NOT a Modeling Error to ignore the intervention when the intervened on variable $v_i$ is NOT an ancestor of any of the question variable $v_j$. In that case, the intervention has no effect on $v_j$ and one should just compute $v_j$ in the original graph.\n",

NEW distributions includes any distribution that is computed in SOLUTIOn but not PROVIDED by QUESTION. For example, the target distribution p($v_i$), is often a NEW probability distribution (which is rarely provided in QUESTION). The SOLUTION will often also contain NEW joint and conditional distributions not directly provided by QUESTION.\n",

      "* In NEW full joint distributions, which often result from multiplying several conditional distributions, erroneous formulas often has incorrect terms, or are missing or have extra terms. This can be a result of making incorrect independence assumptions are made that's not warranted by the graph in QUESTION (e.g substituting  $p(x) \\cdot p(y)$ for $p(x, y)$ or $p(x)$ for $p(x | y)$, when the graph does not suggest independence between x and y). Sometimes the dependence between two variables $v_i$ and $v_j$ is evident only if you look at the full graph or a large enough subgraph (e.g. $v_i$ and $v_j$ are long descendents off of two separate branches off of a common ancestor $v_k$). Sometimes indepedence assumptions are warranted not by the graph structure, but by the numerical value of the distribution (e.g. when $p(V_i=v_i) = 1$ for some $v_i$).\n",
      "\n",
      "* In NEW marginal joint distributions, which involves summing some full joint over values assignments, erroneous formulas often misses summing over some variables (e.g. incorrectly using $p(x) = \\sum_y p(x,y,z)$ when it should have also summed over $z$), or did not sum over all values exhaustively (e.g. incorrectly using $p(x) = p(x,y=0,z=0) + p(x,y=0,z=1)$ which forgets to sum over other values of $y$).\n",

      "* A SOLUTION can also contain a Modeling Error if they did not consider the intervention on $v_i$ properly. This can happen in ONLY two ways, 1) if the SOLUTION attempted to compute the distribution of $v_i$ from its parents, or 2) if the SOLUTION attempted to marginalize over $v_i$ (incorrect since $v_i$ is intervened on and set to a fixed value). \n",

      "What's NOT a Modeling Error? \n",
      "* It is NOT a Modeling Error when the student copied CPTs numerically incorrectly from the QUESTION, or when they multiply or add numbers to incorrect results. This includes misreading the CPTs. These are low-level copy and calculation errors, not Modeling Error.\n",

      "* It is NOT a Modeling Error to ignore the intervention when the intervened on variable $v_i$ is NOT an ancestor of any of the question variable $v_j$. In that case, the intervention has no effect on $v_j$ and one should just compute $v_j$ in the original graph.\n",

Sometimes the dependence between two variables $v_i$ and $v_j$ is evident only if you look at the full graph or a large enough subgraph (e.g. $v_i$ and $v_j$ are long descendents off of two separate branches off of a common ancestor $v_k$). Sometimes indepedence assumptions are warranted not by the graph structure, but by the numerical value of the distribution (e.g. when $p(V_i=v_i) = 1$ for some $v_i$).\n",

Sometimes the dependence between two variables $v_i$ and $v_j$ is evident only if you look at the full graph or a large enough subgraph (e.g. $v_i$ and $v_j$ are long descendents off of two separate branches off of a common ancestor $v_k$). Sometimes indepedence assumptions are warranted not by the graph structure, but by the numerical value of the distribution (e.g. when $p(V_i=v_i) = 1$ for some $v_i$).\n",

Sometimes the dependence between two variables $v_i$ and $v_j$ is evident only if you look at the full graph or a large enough subgraph (e.g. $v_i$ and $v_j$ are long descendents off of two separate branches off of a common ancestor $v_k$). Sometimes indepedence assumptions are warranted not by the graph structure, but by the numerical value of the distribution (e.g. when $p(V_i=v_i) = 1$ for some $v_i$).\n",

This can be a result of making incorrect independence assumptions are made that's not warranted by the graph in QUESTION (e.g substituting  $p(x) \\cdot p(y)$ for $p(x, y)$ or $p(x)$ for $p(x | y)$, when the graph does not suggest independence between x and y). Sometimes the dependence between two variables $v_i$ and $v_j$ is evident only if you look at the full graph or a large enough subgraph (e.g. $v_i$ and $v_j$ are long descendents off of two separate branches off of a common ancestor $v_k$). Sometimes indepedence assumptions are warranted not by the graph structure, but by the numerical value of the distribution (e.g. when $p(V_i=v_i) = 1$ for some $v_i$).\n",

Sometimes the dependence between two variables $v_i$ and $v_j$ is evident only if you look at the full graph or a large enough subgraph (e.g. $v_i$ and $v_j$ are long descendents off of two separate branches off of a common ancestor $v_k$).

NEW distributions includes any distribution that is computed in SOLUTIOn but not PROVIDED by QUESTION. For example, the target distribution p($v_i$), is often a NEW probability distribution (which is rarely provided in QUESTION). The SOLUTION will often also contain NEW joint and conditional distributions not directly provided by QUESTION.\n",

This can be a result of making incorrect independence assumptions are made that's not warranted by the graph in QUESTION (e.g substituting  $p(x) \\cdot p(y)$ for $p(x, y)$ or $p(x)$ for $p(x | y)$, when the graph does not suggest independence between x and y). Sometimes the dependence between two variables $v_i$ and $v_j$ is evident only if you look at the full graph or a large enough subgraph (e.g. $v_i$ and $v_j$ are long descendents off of two separate branches off of a common ancestor $v_k$). Sometimes indepedence assumptions are warranted not by the graph structure, but by the numerical value of the distribution (e.g. when $p(V_i=v_i) = 1$ for some $v_i$).\n",
      "\n",
      "* In NEW marginal joint distributions, which involves summing some full joint over values assignments, erroneous formulas often misses summing over some variables (e.g. incorrectly using $p(x) = \\sum_y p(x,y,z)$ when it should have also summed over $z$), or did not sum over all values exhaustively (e.g. incorrectly using $p(x) = p(x,y=0,z=0) + p(x,y=0,z=1)$ which forgets to sum over other values of $y$).\n",

This can happen in ONLY two ways, 1) if the SOLUTION attempted to compute the distribution of $v_i$ from its parents, or 2) if the SOLUTION attempted to marginalize over $v_i$ (incorrect since $v_i$ is intervened on and set to a fixed value). \n",

The SOLUTION will often also contain NEW joint and conditional distributions not directly provided by QUESTION.\n",

This can be a result of making incorrect independence assumptions are made that's not warranted by the graph in QUESTION (e.g substituting  $p(x) \\cdot p(y)$ for $p(x, y)$ or $p(x)$ for $p(x | y)$, when the graph does not suggest independence between x and y). Sometimes the dependence between two variables $v_i$ and $v_j$ is evident only if you look at the full graph or a large enough subgraph (e.g. $v_i$ and $v_j$ are long descendents off of two separate branches off of a common ancestor $v_k$). Sometimes indepedence assumptions are warranted not by the graph structure, but by the numerical value of the distribution (e.g. when $p(V_i=v_i) = 1$ for some $v_i$).\n",
      "\n",
      "* In NEW marginal joint distributions, which involves summing some full joint over values assignments, erroneous formulas often misses summing over some variables (e.g. incorrectly using $p(x) = \\sum_y p(x,y,z)$ when it should have also summed over $z$), or did not sum over all values exhaustively (e.g. incorrectly using $p(x) = p(x,y=0,z=0) + p(x,y=0,z=1)$ which forgets to sum over other values of $y$).\n",

The SOLUTION will often also contain NEW joint and conditional distributions not directly provided by QUESTION.\n",

      "* In NEW full joint distributions, which often result from multiplying several conditional distributions, erroneous formulas often has incorrect terms, or are missing or have extra terms. This can be a result of making incorrect independence assumptions are made that's not warranted by the graph in QUESTION (e.g substituting  $p(x) \\cdot p(y)$ for $p(x, y)$ or $p(x)$ for $p(x | y)$, when the graph does not suggest independence between x and y). Sometimes the dependence between two variables $v_i$ and $v_j$ is evident only if you look at the full graph or a large enough subgraph (e.g. $v_i$ and $v_j$ are long descendents off of two separate branches off of a common ancestor $v_k$). Sometimes indepedence assumptions are warranted not by the graph structure, but by the numerical value of the distribution (e.g. when $p(V_i=v_i) = 1$ for some $v_i$).\n",
      "\n",
      "* In NEW marginal joint distributions, which involves summing some full joint over values assignments, erroneous formulas often misses summing over some variables (e.g. incorrectly using $p(x) = \\sum_y p(x,y,z)$ when it should have also summed over $z$), or did not sum over all values exhaustively (e.g. incorrectly using $p(x) = p(x,y=0,z=0) + p(x,y=0,z=1)$ which forgets to sum over other values of $y$).\n",

      "* A SOLUTION can also contain a Modeling Error if they did not consider the intervention on $v_i$ properly. This can happen in ONLY two ways, 1) if the SOLUTION attempted to compute the distribution of $v_i$ from its parents, or 2) if the SOLUTION attempted to marginalize over $v_i$ (incorrect since $v_i$ is intervened on and set to a fixed value). \n",

      "What's NOT a Modeling Error? \n",

      "* It is NOT a Modeling Error to ignore the intervention when the intervened on variable $v_i$ is NOT an ancestor of any of the question variable $v_j$. In that case, the intervention has no effect on $v_j$ and one should just compute $v_j$ in the original graph.\n",

This can be a result of making incorrect independence assumptions are made that's not warranted by the graph in QUESTION (e.g substituting  $p(x) \\cdot p(y)$ for $p(x, y)$ or $p(x)$ for $p(x | y)$, when the graph does not suggest independence between x and y). Sometimes the dependence between two variables $v_i$ and $v_j$ is evident only if you look at the full graph or a large enough subgraph (e.g. $v_i$ and $v_j$ are long descendents off of two separate branches off of a common ancestor $v_k$). Sometimes indepedence assumptions are warranted not by the graph structure, but by the numerical value of the distribution (e.g. when $p(V_i=v_i) = 1$ for some $v_i$).\n",

The SOLUTION will often also contain NEW joint and conditional distributions not directly provided by QUESTION.\n",

This can be a result of making incorrect independence assumptions are made that's not warranted by the graph in QUESTION (e.g substituting  $p(x) \\cdot p(y)$ for $p(x, y)$ or $p(x)$ for $p(x | y)$, when the graph does not suggest independence between x and y). Sometimes the dependence between two variables $v_i$ and $v_j$ is evident only if you look at the full graph or a large enough subgraph (e.g. $v_i$ and $v_j$ are long descendents off of two separate branches off of a common ancestor $v_k$). Sometimes indepedence assumptions are warranted not by the graph structure, but by the numerical value of the distribution (e.g. when $p(V_i=v_i) = 1$ for some $v_i$).\n",
      "\n",
      "* In NEW marginal joint distributions, which involves summing some full joint over values assignments, erroneous formulas often misses summing over some variables (e.g. incorrectly using $p(x) = \\sum_y p(x,y,z)$ when it should have also summed over $z$), or did not sum over all values exhaustively (e.g. incorrectly using $p(x) = p(x,y=0,z=0) + p(x,y=0,z=1)$ which forgets to sum over other values of $y$).\n",

      "* A SOLUTION can also contain a Modeling Error if they did not consider the intervention on $v_i$ properly. This can happen in ONLY two ways, 1) if the SOLUTION attempted to compute the distribution of $v_i$ from its parents, or 2) if the SOLUTION attempted to marginalize over $v_i$ (incorrect since $v_i$ is intervened on and set to a fixed value). \n",

      "What's NOT a Modeling Error? \n",

      "* It is NOT a Modeling Error to ignore the intervention when the intervened on variable $v_i$ is NOT an ancestor of any of the question variable $v_j$. In that case, the intervention has no effect on $v_j$ and one should just compute $v_j$ in the original graph.\n",

The SOLUTION will often also contain NEW joint and conditional distributions not directly provided by QUESTION.\n",

This can be a result of making incorrect independence assumptions are made that's not warranted by the graph in QUESTION (e.g substituting  $p(x) \\cdot p(y)$ for $p(x, y)$ or $p(x)$ for $p(x | y)$, when the graph does not suggest independence between x and y). Sometimes the dependence between two variables $v_i$ and $v_j$ is evident only if you look at the full graph or a large enough subgraph (e.g. $v_i$ and $v_j$ are long descendents off of two separate branches off of a common ancestor $v_k$). Sometimes indepedence assumptions are warranted not by the graph structure, but by the numerical value of the distribution (e.g. when $p(V_i=v_i) = 1$ for some $v_i$).\n",

      "* In NEW marginal joint distributions, which involves summing some full joint over values assignments, erroneous formulas often misses summing over some variables (e.g. incorrectly using $p(x) = \\sum_y p(x,y,z)$ when it should have also summed over $z$), or did not sum over all values exhaustively (e.g. incorrectly using $p(x) = p(x,y=0,z=0) + p(x,y=0,z=1)$ which forgets to sum over other values of $y$).\n",

NEW distributions includes any distribution that is computed in SOLUTIOn but not PROVIDED by QUESTION. For example, the target distribution p($v_i$), is often a NEW probability distribution (which is rarely provided in QUESTION). The SOLUTION will often also contain NEW joint and conditional distributions not directly provided by QUESTION.\n",

      "* In NEW full joint distributions, which often result from multiplying several conditional distributions, erroneous formulas often has incorrect terms, or are missing or have extra terms. This can be a result of making incorrect independence assumptions are made that's not warranted by the graph in QUESTION (e.g substituting  $p(x) \\cdot p(y)$ for $p(x, y)$ or $p(x)$ for $p(x | y)$, when the graph does not suggest independence between x and y). Sometimes the dependence between two variables $v_i$ and $v_j$ is evident only if you look at the full graph or a large enough subgraph (e.g. $v_i$ and $v_j$ are long descendents off of two separate branches off of a common ancestor $v_k$). Sometimes indepedence assumptions are warranted not by the graph structure, but by the numerical value of the distribution (e.g. when $p(V_i=v_i) = 1$ for some $v_i$).\n",
      "\n",
      "* In NEW marginal joint distributions, which involves summing some full joint over values assignments, erroneous formulas often misses summing over some variables (e.g. incorrectly using $p(x) = \\sum_y p(x,y,z)$ when it should have also summed over $z$), or did not sum over all values exhaustively (e.g. incorrectly using $p(x) = p(x,y=0,z=0) + p(x,y=0,z=1)$ which forgets to sum over other values of $y$).\n",

      "* A SOLUTION can also contain a Modeling Error if they did not consider the intervention on $v_i$ properly. This can happen in ONLY two ways, 1) if the SOLUTION attempted to compute the distribution of $v_i$ from its parents, or 2) if the SOLUTION attempted to marginalize over $v_i$ (incorrect since $v_i$ is intervened on and set to a fixed value). \n",

      "What's NOT a Modeling Error? \n",
      "* It is NOT a Modeling Error when the student copied CPTs numerically incorrectly from the QUESTION, or when they multiply or add numbers to incorrect results. This includes misreading the CPTs. These are low-level copy and calculation errors, not Modeling Error.\n",

      "* It is NOT a Modeling Error to ignore the intervention when the intervened on variable $v_i$ is NOT an ancestor of any of the question variable $v_j$. In that case, the intervention has no effect on $v_j$ and one should just compute $v_j$ in the original graph.\n",

This can be a result of making incorrect independence assumptions are made that's not warranted by the graph in QUESTION (e.g substituting  $p(x) \\cdot p(y)$ for $p(x, y)$ or $p(x)$ for $p(x | y)$, when the graph does not suggest independence between x and y). Sometimes the dependence between two variables $v_i$ and $v_j$ is evident only if you look at the full graph or a large enough subgraph (e.g. $v_i$ and $v_j$ are long descendents off of two separate branches off of a common ancestor $v_k$). Sometimes indepedence assumptions are warranted not by the graph structure, but by the numerical value of the distribution (e.g. when $p(V_i=v_i) = 1$ for some $v_i$).\n",

NEW distributions includes any distribution that is computed in SOLUTIOn but not PROVIDED by QUESTION. For example, the target distribution p($v_i$), is often a NEW probability distribution (which is rarely provided in QUESTION). The SOLUTION will often also contain NEW joint and conditional distributions not directly provided by QUESTION.\n",

      "* In NEW full joint distributions, which often result from multiplying several conditional distributions, erroneous formulas often has incorrect terms, or are missing or have extra terms. This can be a result of making incorrect independence assumptions are made that's not warranted by the graph in QUESTION (e.g substituting  $p(x) \\cdot p(y)$ for $p(x, y)$ or $p(x)$ for $p(x | y)$, when the graph does not suggest independence between x and y). Sometimes the dependence between two variables $v_i$ and $v_j$ is evident only if you look at the full graph or a large enough subgraph (e.g. $v_i$ and $v_j$ are long descendents off of two separate branches off of a common ancestor $v_k$). Sometimes indepedence assumptions are warranted not by the graph structure, but by the numerical value of the distribution (e.g. when $p(V_i=v_i) = 1$ for some $v_i$).\n",
      "\n",
      "* In NEW marginal joint distributions, which involves summing some full joint over values assignments, erroneous formulas often misses summing over some variables (e.g. incorrectly using $p(x) = \\sum_y p(x,y,z)$ when it should have also summed over $z$), or did not sum over all values exhaustively (e.g. incorrectly using $p(x) = p(x,y=0,z=0) + p(x,y=0,z=1)$ which forgets to sum over other values of $y$).\n",

      "* A SOLUTION can also contain a Modeling Error if they did not consider the intervention on $v_i$ properly. This can happen in ONLY two ways, 1) if the SOLUTION attempted to compute the distribution of $v_i$ from its parents, or 2) if the SOLUTION attempted to marginalize over $v_i$ (incorrect since $v_i$ is intervened on and set to a fixed value). \n",

      "What's NOT a Modeling Error? \n",
      "* It is NOT a Modeling Error when the student copied CPTs numerically incorrectly from the QUESTION, or when they multiply or add numbers to incorrect results. This includes misreading the CPTs. These are low-level copy and calculation errors, not Modeling Error.\n",

      "* It is NOT a Modeling Error to ignore the intervention when the intervened on variable $v_i$ is NOT an ancestor of any of the question variable $v_j$. In that case, the intervention has no effect on $v_j$ and one should just compute $v_j$ in the original graph.\n",

The SOLUTION will often also contain NEW joint and conditional distributions not directly provided by QUESTION.\n",

This can be a result of making incorrect independence assumptions are made that's not warranted by the graph in QUESTION (e.g substituting  $p(x) \\cdot p(y)$ for $p(x, y)$ or $p(x)$ for $p(x | y)$, when the graph does not suggest independence between x and y). Sometimes the dependence between two variables $v_i$ and $v_j$ is evident only if you look at the full graph or a large enough subgraph (e.g. $v_i$ and $v_j$ are long descendents off of two separate branches off of a common ancestor $v_k$). Sometimes indepedence assumptions are warranted not by the graph structure, but by the numerical value of the distribution (e.g. when $p(V_i=v_i) = 1$ for some $v_i$).\n",

      "* In NEW marginal joint distributions, which involves summing some full joint over values assignments, erroneous formulas often misses summing over some variables (e.g. incorrectly using $p(x) = \\sum_y p(x,y,z)$ when it should have also summed over $z$), or did not sum over all values exhaustively (e.g. incorrectly using $p(x) = p(x,y=0,z=0) + p(x,y=0,z=1)$ which forgets to sum over other values of $y$).\n",

The SOLUTION will often also contain NEW joint and conditional distributions not directly provided by QUESTION.\n",

This can be a result of making incorrect independence assumptions are made that's not warranted by the graph in QUESTION (e.g substituting  $p(x) \\cdot p(y)$ for $p(x, y)$ or $p(x)$ for $p(x | y)$, when the graph does not suggest independence between x and y). Sometimes the dependence between two variables $v_i$ and $v_j$ is evident only if you look at the full graph or a large enough subgraph (e.g. $v_i$ and $v_j$ are long descendents off of two separate branches off of a common ancestor $v_k$). Sometimes indepedence assumptions are warranted not by the graph structure, but by the numerical value of the distribution (e.g. when $p(V_i=v_i) = 1$ for some $v_i$).\n",

      "* In NEW marginal joint distributions, which involves summing some full joint over values assignments, erroneous formulas often misses summing over some variables (e.g. incorrectly using $p(x) = \\sum_y p(x,y,z)$ when it should have also summed over $z$), or did not sum over all values exhaustively (e.g. incorrectly using $p(x) = p(x,y=0,z=0) + p(x,y=0,z=1)$ which forgets to sum over other values of $y$).\n",

      "* It is NOT a Modeling Error to ignore the intervention when the intervened on variable $v_i$ is NOT an ancestor of any of the question variable $v_j$. In that case, the intervention has no effect on $v_j$ and one should just compute $v_j$ in the original graph.\n",

The SOLUTION will often also contain NEW joint and conditional distributions not directly provided by QUESTION.\n",

Sometimes the dependence between two variables $v_i$ and $v_j$ is evident only if you look at the full graph or a large enough subgraph (e.g. $v_i$ and $v_j$ are long descendents off of two separate branches off of a common ancestor $v_k$). Sometimes indepedence assumptions are warranted not by the graph structure, but by the numerical value of the distribution (e.g. when $p(V_i=v_i) = 1$ for some $v_i$).\n",

Sometimes the dependence between two variables $v_i$ and $v_j$ is evident only if you look at the full graph or a large enough subgraph (e.g. $v_i$ and $v_j$ are long descendents off of two separate branches off of a common ancestor $v_k$). Sometimes indepedence assumptions are warranted not by the graph structure, but by the numerical value of the distribution (e.g. when $p(V_i=v_i) = 1$ for some $v_i$).\n",

      "* This category of errors focuses on mistakes that happened during the derivation of NEW probability distributions in SOLUTION. NEW distributions includes any distribution that is computed in SOLUTIOn but not PROVIDED by QUESTION. For example, the target distribution p($v_i$), is often a NEW probability distribution (which is rarely provided in QUESTION). The SOLUTION will often also contain NEW joint and conditional distributions not directly provided by QUESTION.\n",

      "* A SOLUTION contains a Modeling Error if any the definition or derivation of a NEW probability distribution contains erroneous probability formulas, indicating a potential error in student's knowledge.\n",
      "\n",
      "* In NEW full joint distributions, which often result from multiplying several conditional distributions, erroneous formulas often has incorrect terms, or are missing or have extra terms. This can be a result of making incorrect independence assumptions are made that's not warranted by the graph in QUESTION (e.g substituting  $p(x) \\cdot p(y)$ for $p(x, y)$ or $p(x)$ for $p(x | y)$, when the graph does not suggest independence between x and y). Sometimes the dependence between two variables $v_i$ and $v_j$ is evident only if you look at the full graph or a large enough subgraph (e.g. $v_i$ and $v_j$ are long descendents off of two separate branches off of a common ancestor $v_k$). Sometimes indepedence assumptions are warranted not by the graph structure, but by the numerical value of the distribution (e.g. when $p(V_i=v_i) = 1$ for some $v_i$).\n",
      "\n",
      "* In NEW marginal joint distributions, which involves summing some full joint over values assignments, erroneous formulas often misses summing over some variables (e.g. incorrectly using $p(x) = \\sum_y p(x,y,z)$ when it should have also summed over $z$), or did not sum over all values exhaustively (e.g. incorrectly using $p(x) = p(x,y=0,z=0) + p(x,y=0,z=1)$ which forgets to sum over other values of $y$).\n",
      "\n",
      "* A SOLUTION can also contain a Modeling Error if they did not consider the intervention on $v_i$ properly. This can happen in ONLY two ways, 1) if the SOLUTION attempted to compute the distribution of $v_i$ from its parents, or 2) if the SOLUTION attempted to marginalize over $v_i$ (incorrect since $v_i$ is intervened on and set to a fixed value). \n",
      "\n",
      "What's NOT a Modeling Error? \n",
      "* It is NOT a Modeling Error when the student copied CPTs numerically incorrectly from the QUESTION, or when they multiply or add numbers to incorrect results. This includes misreading the CPTs. These are low-level copy and calculation errors, not Modeling Error.\n",
      "\n",
      "* It is NOT a Modeling Error to ignore the intervention when the intervened on variable $v_i$ is NOT an ancestor of any of the question variable $v_j$. In that case, the intervention has no effect on $v_j$ and one should just compute $v_j$ in the original graph.\n",

NEW distributions includes any distribution that is computed in SOLUTIOn but not PROVIDED by QUESTION. For example, the target distribution p($v_i$), is often a NEW probability distribution (which is rarely provided in QUESTION). The SOLUTION will often also contain NEW joint and conditional distributions not directly provided by QUESTION.\n",

This can be a result of making incorrect independence assumptions are made that's not warranted by the graph in QUESTION (e.g substituting  $p(x) \\cdot p(y)$ for $p(x, y)$ or $p(x)$ for $p(x | y)$, when the graph does not suggest independence between x and y). Sometimes the dependence between two variables $v_i$ and $v_j$ is evident only if you look at the full graph or a large enough subgraph (e.g. $v_i$ and $v_j$ are long descendents off of two separate branches off of a common ancestor $v_k$). Sometimes indepedence assumptions are warranted not by the graph structure, but by the numerical value of the distribution (e.g. when $p(V_i=v_i) = 1$ for some $v_i$).\n",
      "\n",
      "* In NEW marginal joint distributions, which involves summing some full joint over values assignments, erroneous formulas often misses summing over some variables (e.g. incorrectly using $p(x) = \\sum_y p(x,y,z)$ when it should have also summed over $z$), or did not sum over all values exhaustively (e.g. incorrectly using $p(x) = p(x,y=0,z=0) + p(x,y=0,z=1)$ which forgets to sum over other values of $y$).\n",
      "\n",
      "* A SOLUTION can also contain a Modeling Error if they did not consider the intervention on $v_i$ properly. This can happen in ONLY two ways, 1) if the SOLUTION attempted to compute the distribution of $v_i$ from its parents, or 2) if the SOLUTION attempted to marginalize over $v_i$ (incorrect since $v_i$ is intervened on and set to a fixed value). \n",

      "What's NOT a Modeling Error? \n",
      "* It is NOT a Modeling Error when the student copied CPTs numerically incorrectly from the QUESTION, or when they multiply or add numbers to incorrect results. This includes misreading the CPTs. These are low-level copy and calculation errors, not Modeling Error.\n",

      "* It is NOT a Modeling Error to ignore the intervention when the intervened on variable $v_i$ is NOT an ancestor of any of the question variable $v_j$. In that case, the intervention has no effect on $v_j$ and one should just compute $v_j$ in the original graph.\n",

      "* This category of errors focuses on mistakes that happened during the derivation of NEW probability distributions in SOLUTION. NEW distributions includes any distribution that is computed in SOLUTIOn but not PROVIDED by QUESTION. For example, the target distribution p($v_i$), is often a NEW probability distribution (which is rarely provided in QUESTION). The SOLUTION will often also contain NEW joint and conditional distributions not directly provided by QUESTION.\n",

      "* In NEW full joint distributions, which often result from multiplying several conditional distributions, erroneous formulas often has incorrect terms, or are missing or have extra terms. This can be a result of making incorrect independence assumptions are made that's not warranted by the graph in QUESTION (e.g substituting  $p(x) \\cdot p(y)$ for $p(x, y)$ or $p(x)$ for $p(x | y)$, when the graph does not suggest independence between x and y). Sometimes the dependence between two variables $v_i$ and $v_j$ is evident only if you look at the full graph or a large enough subgraph (e.g. $v_i$ and $v_j$ are long descendents off of two separate branches off of a common ancestor $v_k$). Sometimes indepedence assumptions are warranted not by the graph structure, but by the numerical value of the distribution (e.g. when $p(V_i=v_i) = 1$ for some $v_i$).\n",
      "\n",
      "* In NEW marginal joint distributions, which involves summing some full joint over values assignments, erroneous formulas often misses summing over some variables (e.g. incorrectly using $p(x) = \\sum_y p(x,y,z)$ when it should have also summed over $z$), or did not sum over all values exhaustively (e.g. incorrectly using $p(x) = p(x,y=0,z=0) + p(x,y=0,z=1)$ which forgets to sum over other values of $y$).\n",
      "\n",
      "* A SOLUTION can also contain a Modeling Error if they did not consider the intervention on $v_i$ properly. This can happen in ONLY two ways, 1) if the SOLUTION attempted to compute the distribution of $v_i$ from its parents, or 2) if the SOLUTION attempted to marginalize over $v_i$ (incorrect since $v_i$ is intervened on and set to a fixed value). \n",
      "\n",
      "What's NOT a Modeling Error? \n",
      "* It is NOT a Modeling Error when the student copied CPTs numerically incorrectly from the QUESTION, or when they multiply or add numbers to incorrect results. This includes misreading the CPTs. These are low-level copy and calculation errors, not Modeling Error.\n",
      "\n",
      "* It is NOT a Modeling Error to ignore the intervention when the intervened on variable $v_i$ is NOT an ancestor of any of the question variable $v_j$. In that case, the intervention has no effect on $v_j$ and one should just compute $v_j$ in the original graph.\n",

This can be a result of making incorrect independence assumptions are made that's not warranted by the graph in QUESTION (e.g substituting  $p(x) \\cdot p(y)$ for $p(x, y)$ or $p(x)$ for $p(x | y)$, when the graph does not suggest independence between x and y). Sometimes the dependence between two variables $v_i$ and $v_j$ is evident only if you look at the full graph or a large enough subgraph (e.g. $v_i$ and $v_j$ are long descendents off of two separate branches off of a common ancestor $v_k$). Sometimes indepedence assumptions are warranted not by the graph structure, but by the numerical value of the distribution (e.g. when $p(V_i=v_i) = 1$ for some $v_i$).\n",

NEW distributions includes any distribution that is computed in SOLUTIOn but not PROVIDED by QUESTION. For example, the target distribution p($v_i$), is often a NEW probability distribution (which is rarely provided in QUESTION). The SOLUTION will often also contain NEW joint and conditional distributions not directly provided by QUESTION.\n",

      "* In NEW full joint distributions, which often result from multiplying several conditional distributions, erroneous formulas often has incorrect terms, or are missing or have extra terms. This can be a result of making incorrect independence assumptions are made that's not warranted by the graph in QUESTION (e.g substituting  $p(x) \\cdot p(y)$ for $p(x, y)$ or $p(x)$ for $p(x | y)$, when the graph does not suggest independence between x and y). Sometimes the dependence between two variables $v_i$ and $v_j$ is evident only if you look at the full graph or a large enough subgraph (e.g. $v_i$ and $v_j$ are long descendents off of two separate branches off of a common ancestor $v_k$). Sometimes indepedence assumptions are warranted not by the graph structure, but by the numerical value of the distribution (e.g. when $p(V_i=v_i) = 1$ for some $v_i$).\n",
      "\n",
      "* In NEW marginal joint distributions, which involves summing some full joint over values assignments, erroneous formulas often misses summing over some variables (e.g. incorrectly using $p(x) = \\sum_y p(x,y,z)$ when it should have also summed over $z$), or did not sum over all values exhaustively (e.g. incorrectly using $p(x) = p(x,y=0,z=0) + p(x,y=0,z=1)$ which forgets to sum over other values of $y$).\n",

This can happen in ONLY two ways, 1) if the SOLUTION attempted to compute the distribution of $v_i$ from its parents, or 2) if the SOLUTION attempted to marginalize over $v_i$ (incorrect since $v_i$ is intervened on and set to a fixed value). \n",

NEW distributions includes any distribution that is computed in SOLUTIOn but not PROVIDED by QUESTION. For example, the target distribution p($v_i$), is often a NEW probability distribution (which is rarely provided in QUESTION). The SOLUTION will often also contain NEW joint and conditional distributions not directly provided by QUESTION.\n",
      "\n",
      "* A SOLUTION contains a Modeling Error if any the definition or derivation of a NEW probability distribution contains erroneous probability formulas, indicating a potential error in student's knowledge.\n",
      "\n",
      "* In NEW full joint distributions, which often result from multiplying several conditional distributions, erroneous formulas often has incorrect terms, or are missing or have extra terms. This can be a result of making incorrect independence assumptions are made that's not warranted by the graph in QUESTION (e.g substituting  $p(x) \\cdot p(y)$ for $p(x, y)$ or $p(x)$ for $p(x | y)$, when the graph does not suggest independence between x and y). Sometimes the dependence between two variables $v_i$ and $v_j$ is evident only if you look at the full graph or a large enough subgraph (e.g. $v_i$ and $v_j$ are long descendents off of two separate branches off of a common ancestor $v_k$). Sometimes indepedence assumptions are warranted not by the graph structure, but by the numerical value of the distribution (e.g. when $p(V_i=v_i) = 1$ for some $v_i$).\n",
      "\n",
      "* In NEW marginal joint distributions, which involves summing some full joint over values assignments, erroneous formulas often misses summing over some variables (e.g. incorrectly using $p(x) = \\sum_y p(x,y,z)$ when it should have also summed over $z$), or did not sum over all values exhaustively (e.g. incorrectly using $p(x) = p(x,y=0,z=0) + p(x,y=0,z=1)$ which forgets to sum over other values of $y$).\n",
      "\n",
      "* A SOLUTION can also contain a Modeling Error if they did not consider the intervention on $v_i$ properly. This can happen in ONLY two ways, 1) if the SOLUTION attempted to compute the distribution of $v_i$ from its parents, or 2) if the SOLUTION attempted to marginalize over $v_i$ (incorrect since $v_i$ is intervened on and set to a fixed value). \n",

      "What's NOT a Modeling Error? \n",
      "* It is NOT a Modeling Error when the student copied CPTs numerically incorrectly from the QUESTION, or when they multiply or add numbers to incorrect results. This includes misreading the CPTs. These are low-level copy and calculation errors, not Modeling Error.\n",
      "\n",
      "* It is NOT a Modeling Error to ignore the intervention when the intervened on variable $v_i$ is NOT an ancestor of any of the question variable $v_j$. In that case, the intervention has no effect on $v_j$ and one should just compute $v_j$ in the original graph.\n",
      "\n",

NEW distributions includes any distribution that is computed in SOLUTIOn but not PROVIDED by QUESTION. For example, the target distribution p($v_i$), is often a NEW probability distribution (which is rarely provided in QUESTION). The SOLUTION will often also contain NEW joint and conditional distributions not directly provided by QUESTION.\n",

      "* In NEW full joint distributions, which often result from multiplying several conditional distributions, erroneous formulas often has incorrect terms, or are missing or have extra terms. This can be a result of making incorrect independence assumptions are made that's not warranted by the graph in QUESTION (e.g substituting  $p(x) \\cdot p(y)$ for $p(x, y)$ or $p(x)$ for $p(x | y)$, when the graph does not suggest independence between x and y). Sometimes the dependence between two variables $v_i$ and $v_j$ is evident only if you look at the full graph or a large enough subgraph (e.g. $v_i$ and $v_j$ are long descendents off of two separate branches off of a common ancestor $v_k$). Sometimes indepedence assumptions are warranted not by the graph structure, but by the numerical value of the distribution (e.g. when $p(V_i=v_i) = 1$ for some $v_i$).\n",
      "\n",
      "* In NEW marginal joint distributions, which involves summing some full joint over values assignments, erroneous formulas often misses summing over some variables (e.g. incorrectly using $p(x) = \\sum_y p(x,y,z)$ when it should have also summed over $z$), or did not sum over all values exhaustively (e.g. incorrectly using $p(x) = p(x,y=0,z=0) + p(x,y=0,z=1)$ which forgets to sum over other values of $y$).\n",

      "* A SOLUTION can also contain a Modeling Error if they did not consider the intervention on $v_i$ properly. This can happen in ONLY two ways, 1) if the SOLUTION attempted to compute the distribution of $v_i$ from its parents, or 2) if the SOLUTION attempted to marginalize over $v_i$ (incorrect since $v_i$ is intervened on and set to a fixed value). \n",

      "What's NOT a Modeling Error? \n",

      "* It is NOT a Modeling Error to ignore the intervention when the intervened on variable $v_i$ is NOT an ancestor of any of the question variable $v_j$. In that case, the intervention has no effect on $v_j$ and one should just compute $v_j$ in the original graph.\n",

NEW distributions includes any distribution that is computed in SOLUTIOn but not PROVIDED by QUESTION. For example, the target distribution p($v_i$), is often a NEW probability distribution (which is rarely provided in QUESTION). The SOLUTION will often also contain NEW joint and conditional distributions not directly provided by QUESTION.\n",

      "* In NEW full joint distributions, which often result from multiplying several conditional distributions, erroneous formulas often has incorrect terms, or are missing or have extra terms. This can be a result of making incorrect independence assumptions are made that's not warranted by the graph in QUESTION (e.g substituting  $p(x) \\cdot p(y)$ for $p(x, y)$ or $p(x)$ for $p(x | y)$, when the graph does not suggest independence between x and y). Sometimes the dependence between two variables $v_i$ and $v_j$ is evident only if you look at the full graph or a large enough subgraph (e.g. $v_i$ and $v_j$ are long descendents off of two separate branches off of a common ancestor $v_k$). Sometimes indepedence assumptions are warranted not by the graph structure, but by the numerical value of the distribution (e.g. when $p(V_i=v_i) = 1$ for some $v_i$).\n",
      "\n",
      "* In NEW marginal joint distributions, which involves summing some full joint over values assignments, erroneous formulas often misses summing over some variables (e.g. incorrectly using $p(x) = \\sum_y p(x,y,z)$ when it should have also summed over $z$), or did not sum over all values exhaustively (e.g. incorrectly using $p(x) = p(x,y=0,z=0) + p(x,y=0,z=1)$ which forgets to sum over other values of $y$).\n",
      "\n",
      "* A SOLUTION can also contain a Modeling Error if they did not consider the intervention on $v_i$ properly. This can happen in ONLY two ways, 1) if the SOLUTION attempted to compute the distribution of $v_i$ from its parents, or 2) if the SOLUTION attempted to marginalize over $v_i$ (incorrect since $v_i$ is intervened on and set to a fixed value). \n",

      "What's NOT a Modeling Error? \n",
      "* It is NOT a Modeling Error when the student copied CPTs numerically incorrectly from the QUESTION, or when they multiply or add numbers to incorrect results. This includes misreading the CPTs. These are low-level copy and calculation errors, not Modeling Error.\n",

      "* It is NOT a Modeling Error to ignore the intervention when the intervened on variable $v_i$ is NOT an ancestor of any of the question variable $v_j$. In that case, the intervention has no effect on $v_j$ and one should just compute $v_j$ in the original graph.\n",

Sometimes the dependence between two variables $v_i$ and $v_j$ is evident only if you look at the full graph or a large enough subgraph (e.g. $v_i$ and $v_j$ are long descendents off of two separate branches off of a common ancestor $v_k$).

This can be a result of making incorrect independence assumptions are made that's not warranted by the graph in QUESTION (e.g substituting  $p(x) \\cdot p(y)$ for $p(x, y)$ or $p(x)$ for $p(x | y)$, when the graph does not suggest independence between x and y). Sometimes the dependence between two variables $v_i$ and $v_j$ is evident only if you look at the full graph or a large enough subgraph (e.g. $v_i$ and $v_j$ are long descendents off of two separate branches off of a common ancestor $v_k$). Sometimes indepedence assumptions are warranted not by the graph structure, but by the numerical value of the distribution (e.g. when $p(V_i=v_i) = 1$ for some $v_i$).\n",

      "To find the marginal distribution of \\( v3 \\) given an intervention to set \\( v7 \\) to 0, we need to consider the structural causal model (SCM) and the causal directed acyclic graph (DAG) provided. The intervention \\( do(v7=0) \\) means that we are setting \\( v7 \\) to 0 regardless of its parents, which are \\( v1 \\) and \\( v5 \\). This intervention does not directly affect \\( v3 \\), but it can indirectly affect \\( v3 \\) through the causal relationships in the graph.\n",

      "Modeling Error\n",
      "* This category of errors focuses on mistakes that happened during the derivation of NEW probability distributions in SOLUTION. NEW distributions includes any distribution that is computed in SOLUTIOn but not PROVIDED by QUESTION. For example, the target distribution p($v_i$), is often a NEW probability distribution (which is rarely provided in QUESTION). The SOLUTION will often also contain NEW joint and conditional distributions not directly provided by QUESTION.\n",
      "\n",
      "* A SOLUTION contains a Modeling Error if any the definition or derivation of a NEW probability distribution contains erroneous probability formulas, indicating a potential error in student's knowledge.\n",
      "\n",
      "* In NEW full joint distributions, which often result from multiplying several conditional distributions, erroneous formulas often has incorrect terms, or are missing or have extra terms. This can be a result of making incorrect independence assumptions are made that's not warranted by the graph in QUESTION (e.g substituting  $p(x) \\cdot p(y)$ for $p(x, y)$ or $p(x)$ for $p(x | y)$, when the graph does not suggest independence between x and y). Sometimes the dependence between two variables $v_i$ and $v_j$ is evident only if you look at the full graph or a large enough subgraph (e.g. $v_i$ and $v_j$ are long descendents off of two separate branches off of a common ancestor $v_k$). Sometimes indepedence assumptions are warranted not by the graph structure, but by the numerical value of the distribution (e.g. when $p(V_i=v_i) = 1$ for some $v_i$).\n",
      "\n",
      "* In NEW marginal joint distributions, which involves summing some full joint over values assignments, erroneous formulas often misses summing over some variables (e.g. incorrectly using $p(x) = \\sum_y p(x,y,z)$ when it should have also summed over $z$), or did not sum over all values exhaustively (e.g. incorrectly using $p(x) = p(x,y=0,z=0) + p(x,y=0,z=1)$ which forgets to sum over other values of $y$).\n",
      "\n",
      "* A SOLUTION can also contain a Modeling Error if they did not consider the intervention on $v_i$ properly. This can happen in ONLY two ways, 1) if the SOLUTION attempted to compute the distribution of $v_i$ from its parents, or 2) if the SOLUTION attempted to marginalize over $v_i$ (incorrect since $v_i$ is intervened on and set to a fixed value). \n",
      "\n",
      "What's NOT a Modeling Error? \n",
      "* It is NOT a Modeling Error when the student copied CPTs numerically incorrectly from the QUESTION, or when they multiply or add numbers to incorrect results. This includes misreading the CPTs. These are low-level copy and calculation errors, not Modeling Error.\n",
      "\n",
      "* It is NOT a Modeling Error to ignore the intervention when the intervened on variable $v_i$ is NOT an ancestor of any of the question variable $v_j$. In that case, the intervention has no effect on $v_j$ and one should just compute $v_j$ in the original graph.\n",
      "\n",
      "* Focus on probability formulas that are actually used to compute the solution. If the student makes an erroneous statement but does not make modeling errors in the actual formulas, do NOT count it as a Modeling Error.\n",

NEW distributions includes any distribution that is computed in SOLUTIOn but not PROVIDED by QUESTION. For example, the target distribution p($v_i$), is often a NEW probability distribution (which is rarely provided in QUESTION). The SOLUTION will often also contain NEW joint and conditional distributions not directly provided by QUESTION.\n",

      "* In NEW full joint distributions, which often result from multiplying several conditional distributions, erroneous formulas often has incorrect terms, or are missing or have extra terms. This can be a result of making incorrect independence assumptions are made that's not warranted by the graph in QUESTION (e.g substituting  $p(x) \\cdot p(y)$ for $p(x, y)$ or $p(x)$ for $p(x | y)$, when the graph does not suggest independence between x and y). Sometimes the dependence between two variables $v_i$ and $v_j$ is evident only if you look at the full graph or a large enough subgraph (e.g. $v_i$ and $v_j$ are long descendents off of two separate branches off of a common ancestor $v_k$). Sometimes indepedence assumptions are warranted not by the graph structure, but by the numerical value of the distribution (e.g. when $p(V_i=v_i) = 1$ for some $v_i$).\n",
      "\n",
      "* In NEW marginal joint distributions, which involves summing some full joint over values assignments, erroneous formulas often misses summing over some variables (e.g. incorrectly using $p(x) = \\sum_y p(x,y,z)$ when it should have also summed over $z$), or did not sum over all values exhaustively (e.g. incorrectly using $p(x) = p(x,y=0,z=0) + p(x,y=0,z=1)$ which forgets to sum over other values of $y$).\n",

The SOLUTION will often also contain NEW joint and conditional distributions not directly provided by QUESTION.\n",

This can be a result of making incorrect independence assumptions are made that's not warranted by the graph in QUESTION (e.g substituting  $p(x) \\cdot p(y)$ for $p(x, y)$ or $p(x)$ for $p(x | y)$, when the graph does not suggest independence between x and y). Sometimes the dependence between two variables $v_i$ and $v_j$ is evident only if you look at the full graph or a large enough subgraph (e.g. $v_i$ and $v_j$ are long descendents off of two separate branches off of a common ancestor $v_k$). Sometimes indepedence assumptions are warranted not by the graph structure, but by the numerical value of the distribution (e.g. when $p(V_i=v_i) = 1$ for some $v_i$).\n",

      "* In NEW marginal joint distributions, which involves summing some full joint over values assignments, erroneous formulas often misses summing over some variables (e.g. incorrectly using $p(x) = \\sum_y p(x,y,z)$ when it should have also summed over $z$), or did not sum over all values exhaustively (e.g. incorrectly using $p(x) = p(x,y=0,z=0) + p(x,y=0,z=1)$ which forgets to sum over other values of $y$).\n",
