Only include this field if the distribution_type is \"marginal\", and only when is_numeric is true.

Did the probabilities used in this intermediate step sum to one? Did the parsed value sum to one? Is there a conceptual error despite no obvious numeric contradictions? You HAVE TO clearly point out exactly where the error happened instead of relying on deductions and inference. If an error stem from incorrect values propagated from an earlier step, explicitly mention it, because we don't we don't double count the error when grading. \n",

If the goal variable does not have grandparents then it will simply sum over the parents, this still counts as recursion.\n",

I must emphasize that the student should indicate very explicitly that they are summing over the full joint as the main approach, in order for SOLUTION to count as brute force. For example, it could be indicated by writing down a symbol for the full joint, or stating that they compute the joint distribution and sum over all possible values.\n",

It is very important to also include the listing of conditional probability table from Question as steps, because we want to train students to write rigorous proofs that cite all necessary information explicitly. Do not include specific values, just the description of steps. When describing steps, make sure to group together formulas and value predictions of the same conditional probability values as one step when they appear next to each other.\n",
      "    * \"intermediate_steps\": extracts a list of formal representation of the STEPs taken in the SOLUTION. Each step is a group of statements about conditional probability values or the formula for conditional probability values of some distribution.

      "        * \"intermediate_steps[i].value_parsed\" is a parsed version of the probability table. Only include this field if the distribution_type is \"marginal\", and only when is_numeric is true. It should be a n dimensional list listing the probability of all joint assignments to the output_variables, arranged where the first axis corresponds to the first variable in output_variables, second axis second varible, etc.\n",

Did the probabilities used in this intermediate step sum to one? Did the parsed value sum to one? Is there a conceptual error despite no obvious numeric contradictions? You HAVE TO clearly point out exactly where the error happened instead of relying on deductions and inference. If an error stem from incorrect values propagated from an earlier step, explicitly mention it, because we don't we don't double count the error when grading. \n",

      "            - \"no numeric computation\" refers to when the step didn't literally include any numeric substitutions, but claimed a numeric result. \n",

      "        - \"recursion\" refers to solutions that start from the goal variable, and computes recursively, i.e. attempts to first compute the marginal of its immediate parents, which invokes computation of the marginal of their immediate parents, etc. Solutions that use \"recursion\" will often compute intermediate steps that produce marginals that are not provided in QUESTION. If the goal variable does not have grandparents then it will simply sum over the parents, this still counts as recursion.\n",
      "        - \"brute force summation\" refers to solutions that explicitly write down an symbol for the full joint p(vi, vj, ...) and sums it over all relevant variables other than the goal variable. I must emphasize that the student should indicate very explicitly that they are summing over the full joint as the main approach, in order for SOLUTION to count as brute force. For example, it could be indicated by writing down a symbol for the full joint, or stating that they compute the joint distribution and sum over all possible values.\n",

If the goal variable does not have grandparents then it will simply sum over the parents, this still counts as recursion.\n",
