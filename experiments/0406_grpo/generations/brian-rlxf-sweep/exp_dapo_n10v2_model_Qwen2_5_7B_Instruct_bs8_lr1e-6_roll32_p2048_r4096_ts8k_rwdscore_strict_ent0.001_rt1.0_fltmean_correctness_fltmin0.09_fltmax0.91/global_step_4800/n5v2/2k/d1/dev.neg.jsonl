An interventional setting means that \\( v0 \\) is directly set to 1, and its parents and children are not affected by this intervention.\n\nIn the DAG, \\( v1 \\) has two parents: \\( v0 \\) and \\( v3 \\). Given the intervention \\( v0 = 1 \\), the conditional probability table (CPT) for \\( v1 \\) will only consider the values of \\( v3 \\) and the fixed value of \\( v0 = 1 \\).\n\nThe CPT for \\( v1 \\) given \\( v0 = 1 \\) and \\( v3 \\) is as follows:\n- \\( P(v1 = 0 | v0 = 1, v3 = 0) = 0.72 \\)\n- \\( P(v1 = 1 | v0 = 1, v3 = 0) = 0.28 \\)\n- \\( P(v1 = 0 | v0 = 1, v3 = 1) = 0.33 \\)\n- \\( P(v1 = 1 | v0 = 1, v3 = 1) = 0.67 \\)\n\nSince \\( v0 \\) is intervened to be 1, the CPT simplifies to:\n- \\( P(v1 = 0 | v3 = 0) = 0.72 \\)\n- \\( P(v1 = 1 | v3 = 0) = 0.28 \\)\n- \\( P(v1 = 0 | v3 = 1) = 0.33 \\)\n- \\( P(v1 = 1 | v3 = 1) = 0.67 \\)\n\nNext, we need to compute the marginal distribution of \\( v1 \\) by considering the distribution of \\( v3 \\). The CPT for \\( v3 \\) is:\n- \\( P(v3 = 0) = 0.87 \\)\n- \\( P(v3 = 1) = 0.13 \\)\n\nUsing the law of total probability, we can compute the marginal distribution of \\( v1 \\):\n\\[ P(v1 = 0) = P(v1 = 0 | v3 = 0) \\cdot P(v3 = 0) + P(v1 = 0 | v3 = 1) \\cdot P(v3 = 1) \\]\n\\[ P(v1 = 1) = P(v1 = 1 | v3 = 0) \\cdot P(v3 = 0) + P(v1 = 1 | v3 = 1) \\cdot P(v3 = 1) \\]\n\nSubstituting the values:\n\\[ P(v1 = 0) = (0.72 \\cdot 0.87) + (0.33 \\cdot 0.13) \\]\n\\[ P(v1 = 1) = (0.28 \\cdot 0.87) + (0.67 \\cdot 0.13) \\]\n\nNow, let's compute these values.\n\n\\[ P(v1 = 0) = 0.72 \\cdot 0.87 + 0.33 \\cdot 0.13 = 0.6264 + 0.0429 = 0.6693 \\]\n\\[ P(v1 = 1) = 0.28 \\cdot 0.87 + 0.67 \\cdot 0.13 = 0.2436 + 0.0871 = 0.3307 \\]\n\nThus, the marginal distribution of \\( v1 \\) given the intervention \\( v0 = 1 \\) is:\n\\[ P(v1 = 0) = 0.6693 \\]\n\\[ P(v1 = 1) = 0.3307 \\]\n\nANSWER\n[0.6693, 0.3307]<|im_end|>"]}

An intervention on \\( v2 \\) means that \\( v2 \\) is set to 1 regardless of its natural distribution. This changes the structure of the causal graph, as \\( v2 \\) is no longer a random variable but a fixed value.\n\nSince \\( v2 \\) is intervened upon, we need to consider the conditional probability table (CPT) of \\( v3 \\) given the intervention. The CPT for \\( v3 \\) is given as:\n\\[ P(v3 | v4=0) = [0.94, 0.06] \\]\n\\[ P(v3 | v4=1) = [0.17, 0.83] \\]\n\nGiven the intervention \\( v2 = 1 \\), we need to determine the distribution of \\( v4 \\) and then use the corresponding CPT for \\( v3 \\).\n\nFrom the CPT of \\( v4 \\):\n\\[ P(v4=0) = 0.87 \\]\n\\[ P(v4=1) = 0.13 \\]\n\nNext, we need to determine the distribution of \\( v4 \\) given the intervention \\( v2 = 1 \\). Since \\( v2 \\) is intervened to be 1, the distribution of \\( v4 \\) remains the same as its natural distribution because \\( v4 \\) does not have a direct parent that is intervened upon.\n\nNow, we can use the CPTs of \\( v3 \\) to find the marginal distribution of \\( v3 \\):\n\\[ P(v3=0 | v4=0) = 0.94 \\]\n\\[ P(v3=1 | v4=0) = 0.06 \\]\n\\[ P(v3=0 | v4=1) = 0.17 \\]\n\\[ P(v3=1 | v4=1) = 0.83 \\]\n\nUsing the law of total probability, we can compute the marginal distribution of \\( v3 \\):\n\\[ P(v3=0) = P(v3=0 | v4=0)P(v4=0) + P(v3=0 | v4=1)P(v4=1) \\]\n\\[ P(v3=0) = (0.94 \\times 0.87) + (0.17 \\times 0.13) \\]\n\\[ P(v3=0) = 0.8178 + 0.0221 = 0.84 \\]\n\n\\[ P(v3=1) = P(v3=1 | v4=0)P(v4=0) + P(v3=1 | v4=1)P(v4=1) \\]\n\\[ P(v3=1) = (0.06 \\times 0.87) + (0.83 \\times 0.13) \\]\n\\[ P(v3=1) = 0.0522 + 0.1079 = 0.16 \\]\n\nThus, the marginal distribution of \\( v3 \\) given the intervention \\( v2 = 1 \\) is:\n\\[ P(v3=0) = 0.84 \\]\n\\[ P(v3=1) = 0.16 \\]\n\nANSWER\n[0.84, 0.16]<|im_end|>"]}
