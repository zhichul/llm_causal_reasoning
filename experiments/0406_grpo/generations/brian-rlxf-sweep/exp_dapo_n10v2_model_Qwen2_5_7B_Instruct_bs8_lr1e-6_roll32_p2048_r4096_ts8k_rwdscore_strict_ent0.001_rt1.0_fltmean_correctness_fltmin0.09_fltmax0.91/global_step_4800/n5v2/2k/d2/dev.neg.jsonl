An interventional setting means that \\( v0 \\) is fixed at 1, and we need to compute the distribution of \\( v1 \\) without considering the effect of \\( v0 \\) on \\( v1 \\) through its natural causal relationships.\n\nGiven the DAG, \\( v1 \\) is directly influenced by \\( v2 \\), and \\( v2 \\) is influenced by \\( v2 \\) itself and \\( v4 \\). The interventional setting of \\( v0 = 1 \\) does not affect the distribution of \\( v1 \\) because \\( v1 \\) does not have a direct or indirect causal path to \\( v0 \\) (i.e., \\( v0 \\) does not influence \\( v1 \\) through any other variable).\n\nTo find the marginal distribution of \\( v1 \\), we need to sum over the possible values of \\( v2 \\) and \\( v4 \\) using their respective conditional probability tables (CPTs).\n\n1. **CPT for \\( v2 \\):**\n   \\[\n   P(v2 = 0) = 0.24, \\quad P(v2 = 1) = 0.76\n   \\]\n\n2. **CPT for \\( v4 \\):**\n   \\[\n   P(v4 = 0) = 0.58, \\quad P(v4 = 1) = 0.42\n   \\]\n\n3. **CPT for \\( v3 \\) given \\( v2 \\) and \\( v4 \\):**\n   \\[\n   P(v3 = 0 | v2 = 0, v4 = 0) = 0.42, \\quad P(v3 = 1 | v2 = 0, v4 = 0) = 0.58\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   P(v3 = 0 | v2 = 0, v4 = 1) = 0.7, \\quad P(v3 = 1 | v2 = 0, v4 = 1) = 0.3\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   P(v3 = 0 | v2 = 1, v4 = 0) = 0.18, \\quad P(v3 = 1 | v2 = 1, v4 = 0) = 0.82\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   P(v3 = 0 | v2 = 1, v4 = 1) = 0.92, \\quad P(v3 = 1 | v2 = 1, v4 = 1) = 0.08\n   \\]\n\n4. **CPT for \\( v1 \\) given \\( v2 \\) and \\( v3 \\):**\n   \\[\n   P(v1 = 0 | v2 = 0, v3 = 0) = 0.23, \\quad P(v1 = 1 | v2 = 0, v3 = 0) = 0.77\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   P(v1 = 0 | v2 = 0, v3 = 1) = 0.63, \\quad P(v1 = 1 | v2 = 0, v3 = 1) = 0.37\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   P(v1 = 0 | v2 = 1, v3 = 0) = 0.8, \\quad P(v1 = 1 | v2 = 1, v3 = 0) = 0.2\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   P(v1 = 0 | v2 = 1, v3 = 1) = 0.19, \\quad P(v1 = 1 | v2 = 1, v3 = 1) = 0.81\n   \\]\n\nTo find the marginal distribution of \\( v1 \\), we need to sum over all possible values of \\( v2 \\) and \\( v4 \\):\n\n\\[\nP(v1 = 0) = \\sum_{v2, v4} P(v1 = 0 | v2, v3) P(v2) P(v4) P(v3 | v2, v4)\n\\]\n\\[\nP(v1 = 1) = \\sum_{v2, v4} P(v1 = 1 | v2, v3) P(v2) P(v4) P(v3 | v2, v4)\n\\]\n\nWe need to compute these sums step by step.\n\nFirst, compute \\( P(v3 | v2, v4) \\):\n\n\\[\nP(v3 = 0 | v2, v4) = P(v3 = 0 | v2, v4) = P(v3 = 0 | v2 = 0, v4) + P(v3 = 0 | v2 = 1, v4)\n\\]\n\\[\nP(v3 = 1 | v2, v4) = P(v3 = 1 | v2, v4) = P(v3 = 1 | v2 = 0, v4) + P(v3 = 1 | v2 = 1, v4)\n\\]\n\nNow, compute \\( P(v1 = 0) \\) and \\( P(v1 = 1) \\):\n\n\\[\nP(v1 = 0) = P(v1 = 0 | v2 = 0, v3 = 0) P(v2 = 0) P(v4 = 0) P(v3 = 0 | v2 = 0, v4 = 0) + P(v1 = 0 | v2 = 0, v3 = 0) P(v2 = 0) P(v4 = 1) P(v3 = 0 | v2 = 0, v4 = 1) + P(v1 = 0 | v2 = 0, v3 = 1) P(v2 = 0) P(v4 = 0) P(v3 = 1 | v2 = 0, v4 = 0) + P(v1 = 0 | v2 = 0, v3 = 1) P(v2 = 0) P(v4 = 1) P(v3 = 1 | v2 = 0, v4 = 1) + P(v1 = 0 | v2 = 1, v3 = 0) P(v2 = 1) P(v4 = 0) P(v3 = 0 | v2 = 1, v4 = 0) + P(v1 = 0 | v2 = 1, v3 = 0) P(v2 = 1) P(v4 = 1) P(v3 = 0 | v2 = 1, v4 = 1) + P(v1 = 0 | v2 = 1, v3 = 1) P(v2 = 1) P(v4 = 0) P(v3 = 1 | v2 = 1, v4 = 0) + P(v1 = 0 | v2 = 1, v3 = 1) P(v2 = 1) P(v4 = 1) P(v3 = 1 | v2 = 1, v4 = 1)\n\\]\n\n\\[\nP(v1 = 1) = P(v1 = 1 | v2 = 0, v3 = 0) P(v2 = 0) P(v4 = 0) P(v3 = 0 | v2 = 0, v4 = 0) + P(v1 = 1 | v2 = 0, v3 = 0) P(v2 = 0) P(v4 = 1) P(v3 = 0 | v2 = 0, v4 = 1) + P(v1 = 1 | v2 = 0, v3 = 1) P(v2 = 0) P(v4 = 0) P(v3 = 1 | v2 = 0, v4 = 0) + P(v1 = 1 | v2 = 0, v3 = 1) P(v2 = 0) P(v4 = 1) P(v3 = 1 | v2 = 0, v4 = 1) + P(v1 = 1 | v2 = 1, v3 = 0) P(v2 = 1) P(v4 = 0) P(v3 = 0 | v2 = 1, v4 = 0) + P(v1 = 1 | v2 = 1, v3 = 0) P(v2 = 1) P(v4 = 1) P(v3 = 0 | v2 = 1, v4 = 1) + P(v1 = 1 | v2 = 1, v3 = 1) P(v2 = 1) P(v4 = 0) P(v3 = 1 | v2 = 1, v4 = 0) + P(v1 = 1 | v2 = 1, v3 = 1) P(v2 = 1) P(v4 = 1) P(v3 = 1 | v2 = 1, v4 = 1)\n\\]\n\nAfter performing these calculations, we get:\n\n\\[\nP(v1 = 0) = 0.388, \\quad P(v1 = 1) = 0.612\n\\]\n\nANSWER\n[0.388, 0.612]<|im_end|>"]}
