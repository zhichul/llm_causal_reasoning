The CPT for \\( v1 \\) given \\( v2 \\) and \\( v0 \\) is:\n- \\( P(v1 = 0 | v2=0, v0=0) = 0.35 \\)\n- \\( P(v1 = 1 | v2=0, v0=0) = 0.65 \\)\n- \\( P(v1 = 0 | v2=0, v0=1) = 0.49 \\)\n- \\( P(v1 = 1 | v2=0, v0=1) = 0.51 \\)\n- \\( P(v1 = 0 | v2=1, v0=0) = 0.4 \\)\n- \\( P(v1 = 1 | v2=1, v0=0) = 0.6 \\)\n- \\( P(v1 = 0 | v2=1, v0=1) = 0.57 \\)\n- \\( P(v1 = 1 | v2=1, v0=1) = 0.43 \\)\n\nSince \\( v2 \\) is intervened to be 1, we only need the probabilities where \\( v2 = 1 \\):\n- \\( P(v1 = 0 | v2=1, v0=0) = 0.4 \\)\n- \\( P(v1 = 1 | v2=1, v0=0) = 0.6 \\)\n- \\( P(v1 = 0 | v2=1, v0=1) = 0.57 \\)\n- \\( P(v1 = 1 | v2=1, v0=1) = 0.43 \\)\n\nThe marginal distribution of \\( v1 \\) given \\( v2 = 1 \\) is:\n- \\( P(v1 = 0 | v2=1) = P(v1 = 0 | v2=1, v0=0) \\cdot P(v0=0) + P(v1 = 0 | v2=1, v0=1) \\cdot P(v0=1) \\)\n- \\( P(v1 = 1 | v2=1) = P(v1 = 1 | v2=1, v0=0) \\cdot P(v0=0) + P(v1 = 1 | v2=1, v0=1) \\cdot P(v0=1) \\)\n\nUsing the CPT for \\( v0 \\):\n- \\( P(v0=0) = 0.85 \\)\n- \\( P(v0=1) = 0.15 \\)\n\nWe get:\n- \\( P(v1 = 0 | v2=1) = 0.4 \\cdot 0.85 + 0.57 \\cdot 0.15 = 0.34 + 0.0855 = 0.4255 \\)\n- \\( P(v1 = 1 | v2=1) = 0.6 \\cdot 0.85 + 0.43 \\cdot 0.15 = 0.51 + 0.0645 = 0.5745 \\)\n\nNow, we can compute the distribution of \\( v4 \\) given \\( v2 = 1 \\):\n- \\( P(v4 = 0 | v2=1) = P(v4 = 0 | v2=1, v1=0) \\cdot P(v1 = 0 | v2=1) + P(v4 = 0 | v2=1, v1=1) \\cdot P(v1 = 1 | v2=1) \\)\n- \\( P(v4 = 1 | v2=1) = P(v4 = 1 | v2=1, v1=0) \\cdot P(v1 = 0 | v2=1) + P(v4 = 1 | v2=1, v1=1) \\cdot P(v1 = 1 | v2=1) \\)\n\nUsing the CPT for \\( v4 \\):\n- \\( P(v4 = 0 | v2=1, v1=0) = 0.62 \\)\n- \\( P(v4 = 1 | v2=1, v1=0) = 0.38 \\)\n- \\( P(v4 = 0 | v2=1, v1=1) = 0.13 \\)\n- \\( P(v4 = 1 | v2=1, v1=1) = 0.87 \\)\n\nWe get:\n- \\( P(v4 = 0 | v2=1) = 0.62 \\cdot 0.4255 + 0.13 \\cdot 0.5745 = 0.26471 + 0.074685 = 0.339395 \\)\n- \\( P(v4 = 1 | v2=1) = 0.38 \\cdot 0.4255 + 0.87 \\cdot 0.5745 = 0.16169 + 0.497115 = 0.658805 \\)\n\nFinally, we use the CPT for \\( v3 \\) given \\( v4 \\):\n- \\( P(v3 = 0 | v4=0) = 0.63 \\)\n- \\( P(v3 = 1 | v4=0) = 0.37 \\)\n- \\( P(v3 = 0 | v4=1) = 0.86 \\)\n- \\( P(v3 = 1 | v4=1) = 0.14 \\)\n\nThe marginal distribution of \\( v3 \\) given \\( v2 = 1 \\) is:\n- \\( P(v3 = 0) = P(v3 = 0 | v4=0) \\cdot P(v4=0) + P(v3 = 0 | v4=1) \\cdot P(v4=1) \\)\n- \\( P(v3 = 1) = P(v3 = 1 | v4=0) \\cdot P(v4=0) + P(v3 = 1 | v4=1) \\cdot P(v4=1) \\)\n\nWe get:\n- \\( P(v3 = 0) = 0.63 \\cdot 0.339395 + 0.86 \\cdot 0.658805 = 0.21401535 + 0.5655573 = 0.77957265 \\)\n- \\( P(v3 = 1) = 0.37 \\cdot 0.339395 + 0.14 \\cdot 0.658805 = 0.12557615 + 0.0922327 = 0.21780885 \\)\n\nANSWER\n[0.7796, 0.2178]<|im_end|>"]}
