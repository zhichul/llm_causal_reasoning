The CPT for \\( v4 \\) is given by:\n\\[ P(v4 | v6=0, v0=0) = [0.16, 0.84] \\]\n\\[ P(v4 | v6=0, v0=1) = [0.84, 0.16] \\]\n\\[ P(v4 | v6=1, v0=0) = [0.38, 0.62] \\]\n\\[ P(v4 | v6=1, v0=1) = [0.38, 0.62] \\]\n\nSince \\( v3 \\) is intervened upon and set to 1, we need to determine the distribution of \\( v6 \\) and \\( v0 \\) without considering the effect of \\( v3 \\) on them.\n\nFirst, let's determine the marginal distributions of \\( v6 \\) and \\( v0 \\).\n\nFor \\( v6 \\):\n\\[ P(v6=0 | v1=0) = 0.25 \\]\n\\[ P(v6=0 | v1=1) = 0.65 \\]\n\nThe marginal distribution of \\( v1 \\) is:\n\\[ P(v1=0 | v8=0) = 0.72 \\]\n\\[ P(v1=0 | v8=1) = 0.25 \\]\n\\[ P(v1=1 | v8=0) = 0.28 \\]\n\\[ P(v1=1 | v8=1) = 0.75 \\]\n\nUsing the law of total probability:\n\\[ P(v1=0) = P(v1=0 | v8=0)P(v8=0) + P(v1=0 | v8=1)P(v8=1) \\]\n\\[ P(v1=1) = P(v1=1 | v8=0)P(v8=0) + P(v1=1 | v8=1)P(v8=1) \\]\n\nFrom the CPT of \\( v8 \\):\n\\[ P(v8=0) = 0.16 \\]\n\\[ P(v8=1) = 0.84 \\]\n\nSo,\n\\[ P(v1=0) = (0.72 \\times 0.16) + (0.25 \\times 0.84) = 0.1152 + 0.21 = 0.3252 \\]\n\\[ P(v1=1) = (0.28 \\times 0.16) + (0.75 \\times 0.84) = 0.0448 + 0.63 = 0.6752 \\]\n\nNow, we can find the marginal distribution of \\( v6 \\):\n\\[ P(v6=0) = P(v6=0 | v1=0)P(v1=0) + P(v6=0 | v1=1)P(v1=1) \\]\n\\[ P(v6=0) = (0.25 \\times 0.3252) + (0.65 \\times 0.6752) = 0.0813 + 0.44008 = 0.52138 \\]\n\\[ P(v6=1) = 1 - P(v6=0) = 1 - 0.52138 = 0.47862 \\]\n\nFor \\( v0 \\):\n\\[ P(v0=0 | v2=0) = 0.41 \\]\n\\[ P(v0=0 | v2=1) = 0.93 \\]\n\nThe marginal distribution of \\( v2 \\) is:\n\\[ P(v2=0 | v8=0) = 0.14 \\]\n\\[ P(v2=0 | v8=1) = 0.85 \\]\n\\[ P(v2=1 | v8=0) = 0.86 \\]\n\\[ P(v2=1 | v8=1) = 0.15 \\]\n\nUsing the law of total probability:\n\\[ P(v2=0) = P(v2=0 | v8=0)P(v8=0) + P(v2=0 | v8=1)P(v8=1) \\]\n\\[ P(v2=1) = P(v2=1 | v8=0)P(v8=0) + P(v2=1 | v8=1)P(v8=1) \\]\n\nSo,\n\\[ P(v2=0) = (0.14 \\times 0.16) + (0.85 \\times 0.84) = 0.0224 + 0.714 = 0.7364 \\]\n\\[ P(v2=1) = (0.86 \\times 0.16) + (0.15 \\times 0.84) = 0.1376 + 0.126 = 0.2636 \\]\n\nNow, we can find the marginal distribution of \\( v0 \\):\n\\[ P(v0=0) = P(v0=0 | v2=0)P(v2=0) + P(v0=0 | v2=1)P(v2=1) \\]\n\\[ P(v0=0) = (0.41 \\times 0.7364) + (0.93 \\times 0.2636) = 0.302824 + 0.245348 = 0.548172 \\]\n\\[ P(v0=1) = 1 - P(v0=0) = 1 - 0.548172 = 0.451828 \\]\n\nNow we can use these marginal distributions to find the distribution of \\( v4 \\) given \\( v3 = 1 \\):\n\\[ P(v4=0 | v6=0, v0=0) = 0.16 \\]\n\\[ P(v4=1 | v6=0, v0=0) = 0.84 \\]\n\\[ P(v4=0 | v6=0, v0=1) = 0.84 \\]\n\\[ P(v4=1 | v6=0, v0=1) = 0.16 \\]\n\\[ P(v4=0 | v6=1, v0=0) = 0.38 \\]\n\\[ P(v4=1 | v6=1, v0=0) = 0.62 \\]\n\\[ P(v4=0 | v6=1, v0=1) = 0.38 \\]\n\\[ P(v4=1 | v6=1, v0=1) = 0.62 \\]\n\nThe marginal distribution of \\( v4 \\) is:\n\\[ P(v4=0) = P(v4=0 | v6=0, v0=0)P(v6=0, v0=0) + P(v4=0 | v6=0, v0=1)P(v6=0, v0=1) + P(v4=0 | v6=1, v0=0)P(v6=1, v0=0) + P(v4=0 | v6=1, v0=1)P(v6=1, v0=1) \\]\n\\[ P(v4=1) = P(v4=1 | v6=0, v0=0)P(v6=0, v0=0) + P(v4=1 | v6=0, v0=1)P(v6=0, v0=1) + P(v4=1 | v6=1, v0=0)P(v6=1, v0=0) + P(v4=1 | v6=1, v0=1)P(v6=1, v0=1) \\]\n\nUsing the law of total probability:\n\\[ P(v6=0, v0=0) = P(v6=0)P(v0=0) = 0.52138 \\times 0.548172 = 0.28437 \\]\n\\[ P(v6=0, v0=1) = P(v6=0)P(v0=1) = 0.52138 \\times 0.451828 = 0.23663 \\]\n\\[ P(v6=1, v0=0) = P(v6=1)P(v0=0) = 0.47862 \\times 0.548172 = 0.26263 \\]\n\\[ P(v6=1, v0=1) = P(v6=1)P(v0=1) = 0.47862 \\times 0.451828 = 0.21597 \\]\n\nSo,\n\\[ P(v4=0) = (0.16 \\times 0.28437) + (0.84 \\times 0.23663) + (0.38 \\times 0.26263) + (0.38 \\times 0.21597) \\]\n\\[ P(v4=0) = 0.0455 + 0.1982 + 0.0998 + 0.0820 = 0.4255 \\]\n\\[ P(v4=1) = 1 - P(v4=0) = 1 - 0.4255 = 0.5745 \\]\n\nANSWER\n[0.4255, 0.5745]<|im_end|>"]}

This is an interventional query because we are setting \\( v8 \\) to a specific value (1) rather than observing its natural distribution.\n\nIn an interventional setting, the distribution of \\( v2 \\) will be determined by its parents and any other variables that are not affected by the intervention. The parents of \\( v2 \\) are \\( v5 \\) and \\( v9 \\).\n\nGiven the interventional setting \\( v8 = 1 \\), we need to determine how this affects the distribution of \\( v2 \\).

Therefore, the distribution of \\( v2 \\) will be the same as its natural distribution, which is determined by its parents \\( v5 \\) and \\( v9 \\).\n\nTo find the distribution of \\( v2 \\), we need to consider the possible values of \\( v5 \\) and \\( v9 \\) and their respective conditional probabilities.\n\n1. **Determine the distribution of \\( v5 \\):**\n   \\[\n   P(v5 = 0) = 0.25, \\quad P(v5 = 1) = 0.75\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the distribution of \\( v9 \\):**\n   \\[\n   P(v9 = 0 | v5 = 0, v1 = 0) = 0.33, \\quad P(v9 = 1 | v5 = 0, v1 = 0) = 0.67\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   P(v9 = 0 | v5 = 0, v1 = 1) = 0.74, \\quad P(v9 = 1 | v5 = 0, v1 = 1) = 0.26\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   P(v9 = 0 | v5 = 1, v1 = 0) = 0.76, \\quad P(v9 = 1 | v5 = 1, v1 = 0) = 0.24\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   P(v9 = 0 | v5 = 1, v1 = 1) = 0.15, \\quad P(v9 = 1 | v5 = 1, v1 = 1) = 0.85\n   \\]\n\n3. **Determine the distribution of \\( v1 \\):**\n   \\[\n   P(v1 = 0 | v6 = 0) = 0.38, \\quad P(v1 = 1 | v6 = 0) = 0.62\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   P(v1 = 0 | v6 = 1) = 0.63, \\quad P(v1 = 1 | v6 = 1) = 0.37\n   \\]\n\n4. **Determine the distribution of \\( v6 \\):**\n   \\[\n   P(v6 = 0) = 0.07, \\quad P(v6 = 1) = 0.93\n   \\]\n\n5. **Calculate the joint distribution of \\( v5 \\) and \\( v9 \\):**\n   \\[\n   P(v5 = 0, v9 = 0) = P(v5 = 0) \\cdot P(v9 = 0 | v5 = 0) = 0.25 \\cdot (0.33 \\cdot P(v1 = 0 | v6 = 0) + 0.74 \\cdot P(v1 = 0 | v6 = 1))\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   P(v5 = 0, v9 = 1) = P(v5 = 0) \\cdot P(v9 = 1 | v5 = 0) = 0.25 \\cdot (0.67 \\cdot P(v1 = 0 | v6 = 0) + 0.26 \\cdot P(v1 = 0 | v6 = 1))\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   P(v5 = 1, v9 = 0) = P(v5 = 1) \\cdot P(v9 = 0 | v5 = 1) = 0.75 \\cdot (0.76 \\cdot P(v1 = 0 | v6 = 0) + 0.15 \\cdot P(v1 = 0 | v6 = 1))\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   P(v5 = 1, v9 = 1) = P(v5 = 1) \\cdot P(v9 = 1 | v5 = 1) = 0.75 \\cdot (0.24 \\cdot P(v1 = 0 | v6 = 0) + 0.85 \\cdot P(v1 = 0 | v6 = 1))\n   \\]\n\n6. **Calculate the marginal distribution of \\( v1 \\):**\n   \\[\n   P(v1 = 0) = P(v6 = 0) \\cdot P(v1 = 0 | v6 = 0) + P(v6 = 1) \\cdot P(v1 = 0 | v6 = 1) = 0.07 \\cdot 0.38 + 0.93 \\cdot 0.63 = 0.0266 + 0.5859 = 0.6125\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   P(v1 = 1) = P(v6 = 0) \\cdot P(v1 = 1 | v6 = 0) + P(v6 = 1) \\cdot P(v1 = 1 | v6 = 1) = 0.07 \\cdot 0.62 + 0.93 \\cdot 0.37 = 0.0434 + 0.3431 = 0.3865\n   \\]\n\n7. **Substitute the values:**\n   \\[\n   P(v5 = 0, v9 = 0) = 0.25 \\cdot (0.33 \\cdot 0.6125 + 0.74 \\cdot 0.3865) = 0.25 \\cdot (0.202125 + 0.28461) = 0.25 \\cdot 0.486735 = 0.12168375\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   P(v5 = 0, v9 = 1) = 0.25 \\cdot (0.67 \\cdot 0.6125 + 0.26 \\cdot 0.3865) = 0.25 \\cdot (0.410125 + 0.10049) = 0.25 \\cdot 0.510615 = 0.12765375\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   P(v5 = 1, v9 = 0) = 0.75 \\cdot (0.76 \\cdot 0.6125 + 0.15 \\cdot 0.3865) = 0.75 \\cdot (0.463 + 0.057975) = 0.75 \\cdot 0.520975 = 0.39073125\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   P(v5 = 1, v9 = 1) = 0.75 \\cdot (0.24 \\cdot 0.6125 + 0.85 \\cdot 0.3865) = 0.75 \\cdot (0.147 + 0.328725) = 0.75 \\cdot 0.475725 = 0.35679375\n   \\]\n\n8. **Calculate the distribution of \\( v2 \\):**\n   \\[\n   P(v2 = 0 | v5 = 0, v9 = 0) = 0.14, \\quad P(v2 = 1 | v5 = 0, v9 = 0) = 0.86\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   P(v2 = 0 | v5 = 0, v9 = 1) = 0.13, \\quad P(v2 = 1 | v5 = 0, v9 = 1) = 0.87\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   P(v2 = 0 | v5 = 1, v9 = 0) = 0.33, \\quad P(v2 = 1 | v5 = 1, v9 = 0) = 0.67\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   P(v2 = 0 | v5 = 1, v9 = 1) = 0.31, \\quad P(v2 = 1 | v5 = 1, v9 = 1) = 0.69\n   \\]\n\n9. **Combine the probabilities:**\n   \\[\n   P(v2 = 0) = P(v5 = 0, v9 = 0) \\cdot P(v2 = 0 | v5 = 0, v9 = 0) + P(v5 = 0, v9 = 1) \\cdot P(v2 = 0 | v5 = 0, v9 = 1) + P(v5 = 1, v9 = 0) \\cdot P(v2 = 0 | v5 = 1, v9 = 0) + P(v5 = 1, v9 = 1) \\cdot P(v2 = 0 | v5 = 1, v9 = 1)\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   P(v2 = 0) = 0.12168375 \\cdot 0.14 + 0.12765375 \\cdot 0.13 + 0.39073125 \\cdot 0.33 + 0.35679375 \\cdot 0.31\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   P(v2 = 0) = 0.017035725 + 0.0166150075 + 0.1289413125 + 0.1106051625 = 0.2732\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   P(v2 = 1) = 1 - P(v2 = 0) = 1 - 0.2732 = 0.7268\n   \\]\n\nANSWER\n[0.2732, 0.7268]<|im_end|>"]}

An interventional setting means that \\( v1 \\) is set to 1 regardless of its natural distribution. This changes the structure of the causal model, as \\( v1 \\) is no longer a random variable but a fixed value.\n\nIn the interventional setting, the distribution of \\( v6 \\) will be determined by the conditional probabilities given \\( v2 \\) and the fixed value of \\( v1 = 1 \\). Specifically, we need to use the CPT for \\( v6 \\) given \\( v2 \\) and \\( v3 \\).\n\nThe CPT for \\( v6 \\) is:\n\\[ P(v6 | v2=0, v3=0) = [0.07, 0.93] \\]\n\\[ P(v6 | v2=0, v3=1) = [0.24, 0.76] \\]\n\\[ P(v6 | v2=1, v3=0) = [0.56, 0.44] \\]\n\\[ P(v6 | v2=1, v3=1) = [0.73, 0.27] \\]\n\nSince \\( v1 \\) is intervened to be 1, we need to determine the distribution of \\( v2 \\) and \\( v3 \\) and then use these to find \\( P(v6) \\).\n\nFirst, let's find the distribution of \\( v2 \\):\n\\[ P(v2=0) = 0.26 \\]\n\\[ P(v2=1) = 0.74 \\]\n\nNext, let's find the distribution of \\( v3 \\) given \\( v9 \\). Since \\( v9 \\) is not intervened, we need to consider its distribution given \\( v4 \\). However, \\( v4 \\) is determined by \\( v1 \\), and since \\( v1 \\) is intervened to be 1, we need to find \\( P(v4=0 | v1=1) \\) and \\( P(v4=1 | v1=1) \\).\n\nFrom the CPT for \\( v4 \\):\n\\[ P(v4=0 | v1=1) = 0.13 \\]\n\\[ P(v4=1 | v1=1) = 0.87 \\]\n\nNow, we need to find \\( P(v3 | v9=0, v7=0) \\), \\( P(v3 | v9=0, v7=1) \\), \\( P(v3 | v9=1, v7=0) \\), and \\( P(v3 | v9=1, v7=1) \\).\n\nFrom the CPT for \\( v3 \\):\n\\[ P(v3=0 | v9=0, v7=0) = 0.38 \\]\n\\[ P(v3=1 | v9=0, v7=0) = 0.62 \\]\n\\[ P(v3=0 | v9=0, v7=1) = 0.16 \\]\n\\[ P(v3=1 | v9=0, v7=1) = 0.84 \\]\n\\[ P(v3=0 | v9=1, v7=0) = 0.51 \\]\n\\[ P(v3=1 | v9=1, v7=0) = 0.49 \\]\n\\[ P(v3=0 | v9=1, v7=1) = 0.1 \\]\n\\[ P(v3=1 | v9=1, v7=1) = 0.9 \\]\n\nWe need to find \\( P(v9) \\) given \\( v4 \\).

This is an interventional query because we are setting \\( v6 \\) to a specific value (1) and asking for the distribution of \\( v7 \\).\n\nIn an interventional setting, the distribution of \\( v7 \\) will be determined by its CPT, but we need to consider the effect of setting \\( v6 \\) to 1. However, \\( v7 \\) does not have a direct parent that is \\( v6 \\), so the interventional setting of \\( v6 \\) does not directly affect \\( v7 \\). The distribution of \\( v7 \\) will be the same as its observational distribution, which is given by the CPT of \\( v7 \\).\n\nThe CPT for \\( v7 \\) is defined based on the values of \\( v0 \\) and \\( v8 \\):\n- \\( P(v7 | v0=0, v8=0) = [0.12, 0.88] \\)\n- \\( P(v7 | v0=0, v8=1) = [0.37, 0.63] \\)\n- \\( P(v7 | v0=1, v8=0) = [0.88, 0.12] \\)\n- \\( P(v7 | v0=1, v8=1) = [0.57, 0.43] \\)\n\nTo find the marginal distribution of \\( v7 \\), we need to take the weighted average of these conditional probabilities based on the marginal distributions of \\( v0 \\) and \\( v8 \\).\n\nFirst, we need the marginal distributions of \\( v0 \\) and \\( v8 \\):\n- \\( P(v0) \\) is not directly given, but we can infer it from the CPTs of \\( v0 \\):\n  - \\( P(v0 | v3=0) = [0.58, 0.42] \\)\n  - \\( P(v0 | v3=1) = [0.55, 0.45] \\)\n  - \\( P(v3 | v2=0) = [0.99, 0.01] \\)\n  - \\( P(v3 | v2=1) = [0.4, 0.6] \\)\n  - \\( P(v2) = [0.87, 0.13] \\)\n\n  We can calculate \\( P(v0) \\) as follows:\n  \\[\n  P(v0=0) = P(v0=0 | v3=0)P(v3=0) + P(v0=0 | v3=1)P(v3=1)\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  P(v3=0) = P(v3=0 | v2=0)P(v2=0) + P(v3=0 | v2=1)P(v2=1) = 0.99 \\cdot 0.87 + 0.4 \\cdot 0.13 = 0.8613 + 0.052 = 0.9133\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  P(v3=1) = 1 - P(v3=0) = 1 - 0.9133 = 0.0867\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  P(v0=0) = 0.58 \\cdot 0.9133 + 0.55 \\cdot 0.0867 = 0.530834 + 0.047735 = 0.578569 \\approx 0.5786\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  P(v0=1) = 1 - P(v0=0) = 1 - 0.5786 = 0.4214\n  \\]\n\n- \\( P(v8) = [0.57, 0.43] \\)\n\nNow, we can calculate the marginal distribution of \\( v7 \\):\n\\[\nP(v7=0) = P(v7=0 | v0=0, v8=0)P(v0=0, v8=0) + P(v7=0 | v0=0, v8=1)P(v0=0, v8=1) + P(v7=0 | v0=1, v8=0)P(v0=1, v8=0) + P(v7=0 | v0=1, v8=1)P(v0=1, v8=1)\n\\]\n\\[\nP(v0=0, v8=0) = P(v0=0)P(v8=0) = 0.5786 \\cdot 0.57 = 0.330842\n\\]\n\\[\nP(v0=0, v8=1) = P(v0=0)P(v8=1) = 0.5786 \\cdot 0.43 = 0.249898\n\\]\n\\[\nP(v0=1, v8=0) = P(v0=1)P(v8=0) = 0.4214 \\cdot 0.57 = 0.239178\n\\]\n\\[\nP(v0=1, v8=1) = P(v0=1)P(v8=1) = 0.4214 \\cdot 0.43 = 0.181102\n\\]\n\\[\nP(v7=0) = 0.12 \\cdot 0.330842 + 0.37 \\cdot 0.249898 + 0.88 \\cdot 0.239178 + 0.57 \\cdot 0.181102\n\\]\n\\[\nP(v7=0) = 0.039701 + 0.092462 + 0.211259 + 0.103227 = 0.44665\n\\]\n\\[\nP(v7=1) = 1 - P(v7=0) = 1 - 0.44665 = 0.55335\n\\]\n\nThus, the marginal distribution of \\( v7 \\) is:\n\\[\nP(v7) = [0.4467, 0.5533]\n\\]\n\nANSWER\n[0.4467, 0.5533]<|im_end|>"]}

An interventional setting means that \\( v1 \\) is forced to be 1, and we need to compute the distribution of \\( v8 \\) without considering the natural causal relationships that would otherwise influence \\( v8 \\).\n\nIn the given DAG, \\( v8 \\) is only directly influenced by \\( v2 \\). The CPT for \\( v8 \\) is given as:\n\\[ P(v8 | v2=0) = [0.99, 0.01] \\]\n\\[ P(v8 | v2=1) = [0.91, 0.09] \\]\n\nSince \\( v2 \\) is influenced by \\( v3 \\) and \\( v0 \\), and \\( v3 \\) and \\( v0 \\) are influenced by \\( v6 \\), we need to determine the distribution of \\( v2 \\) given \\( v1 = 1 \\). However, \\( v1 \\) does not directly influence \\( v2 \\), so the intervention on \\( v1 \\) does not change the distribution of \\( v2 \\).\n\nWe need to find \\( P(v2) \\) under the natural distribution, and then use the CPTs for \\( v8 \\) to find \\( P(v8) \\).\n\nFirst, let's find \\( P(v2) \\):\n\\[ P(v2 | v3=0, v0=0) = [0.9, 0.1] \\]\n\\[ P(v2 | v3=0, v0=1) = [0.42, 0.58] \\]\n\\[ P(v2 | v3=1, v0=0) = [0.1, 0.9] \\]\n\\[ P(v2 | v3=1, v0=1) = [0.8, 0.2] \\]\n\nNext, we need to find \\( P(v3) \\) and \\( P(v0) \\):\n\\[ P(v3 | v6=0) = [0.64, 0.36] \\]\n\\[ P(v3 | v6=1) = [0.3, 0.7] \\]\n\\[ P(v0 | v6=0, v9=0) = [0.81, 0.19] \\]\n\\[ P(v0 | v6=0, v9=1) = [0.36, 0.64] \\]\n\\[ P(v0 | v6=1, v9=0) = [0.95, 0.05] \\]\n\\[ P(v0 | v6=1, v9=1) = [0.82, 0.18] \\]\n\nWe need to find \\( P(v6) \\):\n\\[ P(v6) = [0.07, 0.93] \\]\n\nNow, we can find \\( P(v3) \\):\n\\[ P(v3=0 | v6=0) = 0.64 \\]\n\\[ P(v3=1 | v6=0) = 0.36 \\]\n\\[ P(v3=0 | v6=1) = 0.3 \\]\n\\[ P(v3=1 | v6=1) = 0.7 \\]\n\nUsing the law of total probability:\n\\[ P(v3=0) = P(v3=0 | v6=0)P(v6=0) + P(v3=0 | v6=1)P(v6=1) = 0.64 \\times 0.07 + 0.3 \\times 0.93 = 0.0448 + 0.279 = 0.3238 \\]\n\\[ P(v3=1) = 1 - P(v3=0) = 1 - 0.3238 = 0.6762 \\]\n\nNext, we find \\( P(v0) \\):\n\\[ P(v0=0 | v6=0, v9=0) = 0.81 \\]\n\\[ P(v0=0 | v6=0, v9=1) = 0.36 \\]\n\\[ P(v0=0 | v6=1, v9=0) = 0.95 \\]\n\\[ P(v0=0 | v6=1, v9=1) = 0.82 \\]\n\nUsing the law of total probability:\n\\[ P(v0=0 | v6=0) = P(v0=0 | v6=0, v9=0)P(v9=0 | v6=0) + P(v0=0 | v6=0, v9=1)P(v9=1 | v6=0) \\]\n\\[ P(v9=0 | v6=0) = P(v9=0 | v6=0, v0=0)P(v0=0 | v6=0) + P(v9=0 | v6=0, v0=1)P(v0=1 | v6=0) \\]\n\\[ P(v0=0 | v6=0) = 0.81 \\times P(v9=0 | v6=0, v0=0) + 0.36 \\times P(v9=0 | v6=0, v0=1) \\]\n\nWe need \\( P(v9 | v6) \\):\n\\[ P(v9=0 | v6=0) = P(v9=0 | v6=0, v0=0)P(v0=0 | v6=0) + P(v9=0 | v6=0, v0=1)P(v0=1 | v6=0) \\]\n\\[ P(v9=0 | v6=0) = 0.17 \\times P(v0=0 | v6=0) + 0.36 \\times P(v0=1 | v6=0) \\]\n\\[ P(v0=0 | v6=0) = 0.81 \\times 0.17 + 0.36 \\times 0.83 = 0.1377 + 0.3028 = 0.4405 \\]\n\\[ P(v0=1 | v6=0) = 1 - P(v0=0 | v6=0) = 1 - 0.4405 = 0.5595 \\]\n\\[ P(v9=0 | v6=0) = 0.17 \\times 0.4405 + 0.36 \\times 0.5595 = 0.074885 + 0.20142 = 0.276305 \\]\n\\[ P(v9=1 | v6=0) = 1 - P(v9=0 | v6=0) = 1 - 0.276305 = 0.723695 \\]\n\nNow, we can find \\( P(v0=0 | v6=0) \\):\n\\[ P(v0=0 | v6=0) = 0.81 \\times 0.276305 + 0.36 \\times 0.723695 = 0.22215855 + 0.2605298 = 0.48268835 \\]\n\\[ P(v0=1 | v6=0) = 1 - P(v0=0 | v6=0) = 1 - 0.48268835 = 0.51731165 \\]\n\nSimilarly, for \\( v6=1 \\):\n\\[ P(v0=0 | v6=1) = 0.95 \\times 0.36 + 0.82 \\times 0.64 = 0.342 + 0.5248 = 0.8668 \\]\n\\[ P(v0=1 | v6=1) = 1 - P(v0=0 | v6=1) = 1 - 0.8668 = 0.1332 \\]\n\nNow, we can find \\( P(v0) \\):\n\\[ P(v0=0) = P(v0=0 | v6=0)P(v6=0) + P(v0=0 | v6=1)P(v6=1) = 0.48268835 \\times 0.07 + 0.8668 \\times 0.93 = 0.0337881845 + 0.806284 = 0.8400721845 \\]\n\\[ P(v0=1) = 1 - P(v0=0) = 1 - 0.8400721845 = 0.1599278155 \\]\n\nNow, we can find \\( P(v2) \\):\n\\[ P(v2=0 | v3=0, v0=0) = 0.9 \\]\n\\[ P(v2=0 | v3=0, v0=1) = 0.42 \\]\n\\[ P(v2=0 | v3=1, v0=0) = 0.1 \\]\n\\[ P(v2=0 | v3=1, v0=1) = 0.8 \\]\n\nUsing the law of total probability:\n\\[ P(v2=0) = P(v2=0 | v3=0, v0=0)P(v3=0, v0=0) + P(v2=0 | v3=0, v0=1)P(v3=0, v0=1) + P(v2=0 | v3=1, v0=0)P(v3=1, v0=0) + P(v2=0 | v3=1, v0=1)P(v3=1, v0=1) \\]\n\\[ P(v3=0, v0=0) = P(v3=0)P(v0=0) = 0.3238 \\times 0.8400721845 = 0.271877 \\]\n\\[ P(v3=0, v0=1) = P(v3=0)P(v0=1) = 0.3238 \\times 0.1599278155 = 0.051873 \\]\n\\[ P(v3=1, v0=0) = P(v3=1)P(v0=0) = 0.6762 \\times 0.8400721845 = 0.568723 \\]\n\\[ P(v3=1, v0=1) = P(v3=1)P(v0=1) = 0.6762 \\times 0.1599278155 = 0.108149 \\]\n\nNow, we can find \\( P(v2=0) \\):\n\\[ P(v2=0) = 0.9 \\times 0.271877 + 0.42 \\times 0.051873 + 0.1 \\times 0.568723 + 0.8 \\times 0.108149 = 0.2446893 + 0.02178766 + 0.0568723 + 0.0865192 = 0.41086846 \\]\n\\[ P(v2=1) = 1 - P(v2=0) = 1 - 0.41086846 = 0.58913154 \\]\n\nFinally, we can find \\( P(v8) \\):\n\\[ P(v8=0) = P(v8=0 | v2=0)P(v2=0) + P(v8=0 | v2=1)P(v2=1) = 0.99 \\times 0.41086846 + 0.91 \\times 0.58913154 = 0.4067597754 + 0.5362415194 = 0.9430012948 \\]\n\\[ P(v8=1) = 1 - P(v8=0) = 1 - 0.9430012948 = 0.0569987052 \\]\n\nANSWER\n[0.9430, 0.0570]<|im_end|>"]}
