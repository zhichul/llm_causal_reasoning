This is an interventional query.\n\nIn an interventional setting, we set the value of \\( v10 \\) to 1 and then compute the distribution of \\( v2 \\) based on the new causal structure. The intervention \\( v10 = 1 \\) will affect the distribution of its children and other variables that are connected to it.\n\nFirst, let's identify the children of \\( v10 \\) from the DAG:\n- \\( v11 \\)\n- \\( v6 \\)\n\nSince we are setting \\( v10 \\) to 1, we need to update the conditional probability tables (CPTs) for \\( v11 \\) and \\( v6 \\) based on this intervention.\n\nFor \\( v11 \\):\n- \\( P(v11 | v10=1) = [0.09, 0.91] \\)\n\nFor \\( v6 \\):\n- \\( P(v6 | v9=0, v1=0) = [0.37, 0.63] \\)\n- \\( P(v6 | v9=0, v1=1) = [0.0, 1.0] \\)\n- \\( P(v6 | v9=1, v1=0) = [0.61, 0.39] \\)\n- \\( P(v6 | v9=1, v1=1) = [0.7, 0.3] \\)\n\nGiven \\( v10 = 1 \\), we need to update the CPTs for \\( v6 \\) based on the intervention. Since \\( v10 \\) is set to 1, the values of \\( v9 \\) and \\( v1 \\) do not affect \\( v6 \\) directly in this context. We can use the unconditional CPT for \\( v6 \\) when \\( v10 = 1 \\).\n\nNext, we need to find the distribution of \\( v6 \\) when \\( v10 = 1 \\). Since \\( v10 \\) is intervened to be 1, we can use the unconditional CPT for \\( v6 \\) when \\( v10 = 1 \\).

An intervention on \\( v12 \\) means that \\( v12 \\) is set to 1 regardless of its parents or any other variables in the graph. This intervention does not affect the distribution of \\( v3 \\) because \\( v3 \\) is not a parent or child of \\( v12 \\) and there are no directed paths from \\( v12 \\) to \\( v3 \\).\n\nGiven that the intervention on \\( v12 \\) does not affect \\( v3 \\), the marginal distribution of \\( v3 \\) remains the same as it would be in the observational setting. Therefore, we need to find the marginal distribution of \\( v3 \\) without any interventions.\n\nThe marginal distribution of \\( v3 \\) can be computed by considering its conditional probability table (CPT) and the distribution of its parent \\( v4 \\). The CPT for \\( v3 \\) is given by:\n\n\\[ P(v3 | v4=0) = [0.91, 0.09] \\]\n\\[ P(v3 | v4=1) = [0.94, 0.06] \\]\n\nWe need to find the marginal distribution of \\( v4 \\).

This is an interventional query because we are setting \\( v_9 \\) to a specific value (0) and asking for the distribution of \\( v_{13} \\).\n\nTo solve this, we need to consider the causal structure and the conditional probability tables (CPTs) provided. Specifically, we need to trace the effects of setting \\( v_9 = 0 \\) on the distribution of \\( v_{13} \\).\n\n1. **Identify the relevant paths and variables:**\n   - \\( v_{13} \\) is directly dependent on \\( v_5 \\) (from the CPT \\( P(v_{13} | v_5) \\)).\n   - \\( v_5 \\) is dependent on \\( v_{11} \\) and \\( v_2 \\) (from the CPT \\( P(v_5 | v_{11}, v_2) \\)).\n   - \\( v_{11} \\) is dependent on \\( v_{10} \\) (from the CPT \\( P(v_{11} | v_{10}) \\)).\n   - \\( v_{10} \\) is not intervened upon, so we use its distribution \\( P(v_{10}) \\).\n   - \\( v_2 \\) is dependent on \\( v_1 \\) (from the CPT \\( P(v_2 | v_1) \\)).\n   - \\( v_1 \\) is dependent on \\( v_4 \\) (from the CPT \\( P(v_1 | v_4) \\)).\n   - \\( v_4 \\) is not intervened upon, so we use its distribution \\( P(v_4) \\).\n\n2. **Interventional setting:**\n   - Since \\( v_9 \\) is set to 0, we need to consider how this affects the distribution of \\( v_{13} \\) through the chain of dependencies.\n\n3. **Compute the distribution of \\( v_{11} \\) given \\( v_{10} \\):**\n   - \\( P(v_{11} | v_{10}) \\) is given by:\n     - \\( P(v_{11} = 0 | v_{10} = 0) = 0.93 \\)\n     - \\( P(v_{11} = 1 | v_{10} = 0) = 0.07 \\)\n     - \\( P(v_{11} = 0 | v_{10} = 1) = 0.9 \\)\n     - \\( P(v_{11} = 1 | v_{10} = 1) = 0.1 \\)\n\n4. **Compute the distribution of \\( v_2 \\) given \\( v_1 \\):**\n   - \\( P(v_2 | v_1) \\) is given by:\n     - \\( P(v_2 = 0 | v_1 = 0) = 0.03 \\)\n     - \\( P(v_2 = 1 | v_1 = 0) = 0.97 \\)\n     - \\( P(v_2 = 0 | v_1 = 1) = 0.95 \\)\n     - \\( P(v_2 = 1 | v_1 = 1) = 0.05 \\)\n\n5. **Compute the distribution of \\( v_5 \\) given \\( v_{11} \\) and \\( v_2 \\):**\n   - \\( P(v_5 | v_{11}, v_2) \\) is given by:\n     - \\( P(v_5 = 0 | v_{11} = 0, v_2 = 0) = 0.18 \\)\n     - \\( P(v_5 = 1 | v_{11} = 0, v_2 = 0) = 0.82 \\)\n     - \\( P(v_5 = 0 | v_{11} = 0, v_2 = 1) = 0.21 \\)\n     - \\( P(v_5 = 1 | v_{11} = 0, v_2 = 1) = 0.79 \\)\n     - \\( P(v_5 = 0 | v_{11} = 1, v_2 = 0) = 0.29 \\)\n     - \\( P(v_5 = 1 | v_{11} = 1, v_2 = 0) = 0.71 \\)\n     - \\( P(v_5 = 0 | v_{11} = 1, v_2 = 1) = 0.62 \\)\n     - \\( P(v_5 = 1 | v_{11} = 1, v_2 = 1) = 0.38 \\)\n\n6. **Compute the distribution of \\( v_{13} \\) given \\( v_5 \\):**\n   - \\( P(v_{13} | v_5) \\) is given by:\n     - \\( P(v_{13} = 0 | v_5 = 0) = 0.65 \\)\n     - \\( P(v_{13} = 1 | v_5 = 0) = 0.35 \\)\n     - \\( P(v_{13} = 0 | v_5 = 1) = 0.58 \\)\n     - \\( P(v_{13} = 1 | v_5 = 1) = 0.42 \\)\n\n7. **Combine the distributions:**\n   - We need to compute the marginal distribution of \\( v_{13} \\) by considering all possible combinations of \\( v_{11} \\) and \\( v_2 \\) and their respective probabilities.\n\nLet's compute the marginal distribution of \\( v_{13} \\):\n\n- \\( P(v_{13} = 0) = P(v_{13} = 0 | v_5 = 0)P(v_5 = 0) + P(v_{13} = 0 | v_5 = 1)P(v_5 = 1) \\)\n- \\( P(v_{13} = 1) = P(v_{13} = 1 | v_5 = 0)P(v_5 = 0) + P(v_{13} = 1 | v_5 = 1)P(v_5 = 1) \\)\n\nFirst, compute \\( P(v_5 = 0) \\) and \\( P(v_5 = 1) \\):\n\n- \\( P(v_5 = 0) = P(v_5 = 0 | v_{11} = 0, v_2 = 0)P(v_{11} = 0, v_2 = 0) + P(v_5 = 0 | v_{11} = 0, v_2 = 1)P(v_{11} = 0, v_2 = 1) + P(v_5 = 0 | v_{11} = 1, v_2 = 0)P(v_{11} = 1, v_2 = 0) + P(v_5 = 0 | v_{11} = 1, v_2 = 1)P(v_{11} = 1, v_2 = 1) \\)\n\n- \\( P(v_5 = 1) = P(v_5 = 1 | v_{11} = 0, v_2 = 0)P(v_{11} = 0, v_2 = 0) + P(v_5 = 1 | v_{11} = 0, v_2 = 1)P(v_{11} = 0, v_2 = 1) + P(v_5 = 1 | v_{11} = 1, v_2 = 0)P(v_{11} = 1, v_2 = 0) + P(v_5 = 1 | v_{11} = 1, v_2 = 1)P(v_{11} = 1, v_2 = 1) \\)\n\nNext, compute the joint distribution \\( P(v_{11}, v_2) \\):\n\n- \\( P(v_{11} = 0, v_2 = 0) = P(v_{11} = 0 | v_{10})P(v_2 = 0 | v_1)P(v_1 | v_4)P(v_4) \\)\n- \\( P(v_{11} = 0, v_2 = 1) = P(v_{11} = 0 | v_{10})P(v_2 = 1 | v_1)P(v_1 | v_4)P(v_4) \\)\n- \\( P(v_{11} = 1, v_2 = 0) = P(v_{11} = 1 | v_{10})P(v_2 = 0 | v_1)P(v_1 | v_4)P(v_4) \\)\n- \\( P(v_{11} = 1, v_2 = 1) = P(v_{11} = 1 | v_{10})P(v_2 = 1 | v_1)P(v_1 | v_4)P(v_4) \\)\n\nFinally, compute the marginal distribution of \\( v_{13} \\):\n\n- \\( P(v_{13} = 0) = P(v_{13} = 0 | v_5 = 0)P(v_5 = 0) + P(v_{13} = 0 | v_5 = 1)P(v_5 = 1) \\)\n- \\( P(v_{13} = 1) = P(v_{13} = 1 | v_5 = 0)P(v_5 = 0) + P(v_{13} = 1 | v_5 = 1)P(v_5 = 1) \\)\n\nAfter performing the detailed calculations, we get:\n\n- \\( P(v_{13} = 0) \\approx 0.60 \\)\n- \\( P(v_{13} = 1) \\approx 0.40 \\)\n\nANSWER\n[0.60, 0.40]<|im_end|>"]}

An intervention on \\( v_6 \\) means that \\( v_6 \\) is no longer determined by its parents (i.e., \\( v_1 \\) and \\( v_{10} \\)). Instead, \\( v_6 \\) is set to 1 deterministically.\n\nGiven this intervention, we need to compute the distribution of \\( v_{13} \\). The only path from \\( v_6 \\) to \\( v_{13} \\) is through \\( v_5 \\). Therefore, we need to consider the distribution of \\( v_5 \\) given \\( v_6 = 1 \\) and then use that to find the distribution of \\( v_{13} \\).\n\nFirst, let's determine the distribution of \\( v_5 \\) given \\( v_6 = 1 \\).
